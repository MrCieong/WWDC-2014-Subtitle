1
00:00:14,016 --> 00:00:15,075
good morning

2
00:00:15,075 --> 00:00:18,100
and welcome to WWDC session on Ironwood
branch

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,088
I'm prescod you up and I'm here with my
colleague

4
00:00:22,088 --> 00:00:25,119
ready to party to share with you how
beautiful ring

5
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:29,040
the Ironwood branch platform we have
some

6
00:00:29,004 --> 00:00:32,093
awesome stuff you're bringing to you
this fall and I can't wait to share it

7
00:00:33,029 --> 00:00:33,080
with you

8
00:00:33,008 --> 00:00:38,030
but before we go there knowing some of
you are probably knew to advertising

9
00:00:39,002 --> 00:00:42,311
and perhaps you know what I hadn't been
for the first time

10
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:45,630
that stock with two foundational
questions

11
00:00:45,063 --> 00:00:49,092
why advertise and why

12
00:00:49,092 --> 00:00:52,123
I had left after the fourth question

13
00:00:53,023 --> 00:00:57,030
why advertise see you develop this app

14
00:00:57,003 --> 00:01:02,065
you put a lot of time and energy in that
and put it on the App Store

15
00:01:02,092 --> 00:01:05,108
not do things can happen

16
00:01:06,008 --> 00:01:09,014
first users can find your app

17
00:01:09,068 --> 00:01:13,096
our second you can find users for your
app

18
00:01:13,096 --> 00:01:17,138
users will find your app if they know
about you

19
00:01:18,038 --> 00:01:22,407
audio app is featured in one other
categories in the App Store

20
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:26,390
but with thousands of ups

21
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:30,134
coming on App Store everyday natural
discovery of a rap

22
00:01:31,034 --> 00:01:35,046
becomes increasingly difficult and you
don't have much control on

23
00:01:35,046 --> 00:01:38,775
so what can you do to take more control

24
00:01:39,189 --> 00:01:44,020
on the success of your app you

25
00:01:44,002 --> 00:01:49,031
can advertise when you advertise you can
find the right users

26
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:53,117
that make the difference and when it
comes to advertising

27
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:57,840
your ops audio products to millions

28
00:01:57,084 --> 00:02:01,085
of Apple customers around the world I
had

29
00:02:01,085 --> 00:02:04,444

30
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:08,630

00:11:25,011 --> 00:11:25,110
Apple product

159
00:11:26,001 --> 00:11:30,097

very easy for you

160

to define your audience at the highest
level

00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:42,360
and manual are targeting

163
00:11:42,036 --> 00:11:46,040
which is signed the demo is the simplest
and probably the most powerful option we

164
00:11:46,076 --> 00:11:47,093
have 1 I'd workbench

165
00:11:47,093 --> 00:11:50,252
this is where I had does

166
00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:54,810
all the heavy lifting for you if you
want control

172
00:12:15,098 --> 00:12:18,139
age group that you want to target for
geo

173
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:22,137
you can choose I specify states and EM
is

174
00:12:23,037 --> 00:12:26,114
that you want to target for users on the
right side

175
00:12:27,014 --> 00:12:31,077
that some very powerful options starting
to the top

176
00:12:31,077 --> 00:12:34,456
iTunes preferences is an option

177
00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:41,190
that is exclusive to I had this is where
the power of the App Store

178
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:45,091
and iTunes Store comes together to help
you find the right audience

179
00:12:45,091 --> 00:12:50,890
when you make a selection here you're
basically selecting users

180
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:55,410
called actually downloaded content in
that category

181
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:59,085
so if you were to promote a health and
fitness

182
00:12:59,085 --> 00:13:05,092
ap wouldn't it be great if you could

188
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:31,147
that scheduling and how often

189
00:13:32,047 --> 00:13:35,226
do you wanna show and had to a
particular user which is frequency

190
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:36,170

191
00:13:36,017 --> 00:13:39,102
you can mix and match any of these
options

192
00:13:40,002 --> 00:13:43,088

193
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:47,166

199
00:14:07,099 --> 00:14:11,113
is the maximum you're willing to pay
when you win the auction

200
00:14:12,013 --> 00:14:16,031
I'd workbench is a bit odd marketplace

201
00:14:16,031 --> 00:14:20,120
and on this platform you have the peace
of mind to know

202
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,440
that you only pay up anymore

203
00:14:23,044 --> 00:14:28,125
than the next highest bidder now let's
look at the options you have been

204
00:14:29,025 --> 00:14:29,114
creating your ad

205
00:14:30,014 --> 00:14:33,036
there are a range of options you have

206
00:14:33,036 --> 00:14:37,635
when it comes to selecting your act you
can have banner ads

207
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:42,660
video ads which are also known as people

208
00:14:42,066 --> 00:14:49,066
are rich media ads if you want higher
engagement of the user's guides

209
00:14:51,003 --> 00:14:55,035
banner ads provide aid direct path to
action

210
00:14:55,035 --> 00:14:59,103
up on top of a banner you can take a
user directly to an iTunes product page

211
00:15:00,003 --> 00:15:03,036
are to a mobile website up on top of a
banner

212
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:07,087
you can also take a user and show them a
video

213
00:15:07,087 --> 00:15:12,556
and then take them to iTunes product
page are to a mobile website

214
00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:17,770
let's take a look as an example how a
banner ad looks like

215
00:15:17,077 --> 00:15:22,083
here's a nap you see the add will render
at the bottom

216
00:15:23,037 --> 00:15:27,066
after a few seconds to ad will refresh

217
00:15:27,066 --> 00:15:31,122
the use and engage us with the ad

218
00:15:32,022 --> 00:15:35,891
and when the user clicks on it the user
is taken to the App Store

219
00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:39,150
the user can download the app at this
point

220
00:15:39,699 --> 00:15:42,763
now once the user downloads the app

221
00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:47,388
we don't chill the same download add
again to this user

222
00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:50,841
which means you don't waste your money

223
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:57,760
showing ads to users who already have
your app

225
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:06,039
before a video content they play
directly in a full screen mode

226
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:10,077
between you ads you can also have an
optional call to action

227
00:16:10,077 --> 00:16:13,099
which will take the user can I do this
product page

228
00:16:13,099 --> 00:16:16,118
on a mobile website here's an example

229
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:21,026
above you can chase lie or let the light
chase you

230
00:16:21,098 --> 00:16:27,116

231
00:16:28,016 --> 00:16:34,445
light right for iPhone now available in
the app's

232
00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:38,390
as you noticed there was a lot more link
at the bottom of that BDO

233
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:41,988
the user clicks on that lamar link and
the user is taken tonight is perfect

234
00:16:42,339 --> 00:16:42,345

you can also have the user go to a
mobile website

236
00:16:46,043 --> 00:16:49,048
if you want to create rich media ads

237
00:16:49,093 --> 00:16:54,127
for more hiring agement you can do that
using I don't think as well

238
00:16:55,027 --> 00:16:58,946
up on top of a banner you can in March

features and any combination of cargo

241
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:07,280
actions

242
00:17:07,028 --> 00:17:11,036
to create a rich media I show you an
example

243
00:17:11,036 --> 00:17:14,345
but the couple I and had actually used
really good features

244
00:17:14,669 --> 00:17:18,760
to create a great experience let's take
a look

245
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:23,652
here's the app you see the had been
rendered

246
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:29,700
the user taps on the ad and it's taken
is a must into a brand experience

247
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:34,986
the user can browse through the pictures
gallery

248
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,040
the user has been it is still within the
app

249
00:17:40,004 --> 00:17:43,083
you can take the user to Facebook so you
can have a Facebook integration

250
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:46,180
you can have the user like your page on
Facebook

251
00:17:47,008 --> 00:17:52,052
you can have the reservations Mar module
within the app

252
00:17:53,024 --> 00:17:58,026
finally you can integrate the app
download right from this plea

253
00:17:58,026 --> 00:18:01,079
so as you see I'm in the you can do a
lot of things when it comes to reach me

254
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:03,094
gots

255
00:18:03,094 --> 00:18:06,096
now that awesome add was created

256
00:18:07,014 --> 00:18:11,028
using a free tool that is available to
everyone

257
00:18:11,028 --> 00:18:14,122
which is gone as I producer

258
00:18:15,022 --> 00:18:18,035
without producer you can create

259
00:18:18,035 --> 00:18:22,129
highly interactive rich media ads they
made it so easy for you

260
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:27,032
that you can just drag and drop your
assets in a visual layout

261
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:31,070
are you can customize the visual mail

262
00:18:31,007 --> 00:18:35,066
you provide you with an extensive
library a $4,500 blueprints

263
00:18:36,029 --> 00:18:39,097
which I like templates and when you use
one of these blueprints

264
00:18:39,097 --> 00:18:42,134
the combat built in performance and Alex

265
00:18:43,034 --> 00:18:46,048
so you can see how you use it is
engaging and interacting

266
00:18:46,048 --> 00:18:51,073
with the rich media ad and finally with
I pretty the 4.2

267
00:18:51,073 --> 00:18:55,272
that was introduced just two weeks ago

268
00:18:55,929 --> 00:18:59,002
yet integrated I producer with workbench

269
00:18:59,659 --> 00:19:02,664
which means if you create an ad using I
producer

270
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:07,233
you can now applauded directly onto
workbench

271
00:19:07,899 --> 00:19:11,090
and then you go to work bench

272
00:19:11,009 --> 00:19:15,010
you have it available to use

273
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:18,036
so want to create a campaign

274
00:19:18,036 --> 00:19:24,355
your campaign is running and you want to
see how the companies performing

275
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:28,300
when it comes to camp in performance
people I do rich

276
00:19:28,003 --> 00:19:31,044
and Alex that helps you understand how
your campaign is doing

277
00:19:31,071 --> 00:19:34,072
so you can take the right actions

278
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:37,103
to give you data performance metrics as
well as conversion metrics

279
00:19:38,003 --> 00:19:41,005
which includes you know what you spend
is your top two readers

280
00:19:41,023 --> 00:19:46,086
number of impressions you've got as well
as the downloads that you received

281
00:19:46,086 --> 00:19:51,162
so you can tune your campaign you
provide you this data at every level

282
00:19:52,062 --> 00:19:55,088
at the aggregate campaign level as well
as

283
00:19:55,088 --> 00:19:58,184
at Lord line and adults

284
00:19:59,084 --> 00:20:02,152
you can also download is data as a CSV
file

285
00:20:03,052 --> 00:20:06,146
from any of the mouth extreme

286
00:20:07,046 --> 00:20:10,505
so at this point I'll ask lobby to walk
us through some of these tools and

287
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:12,690
options that we talked about

00:30:31,082 --> 00:30:35,087
reporting then you can get the metric

425
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:39,105
and perform their of Ryan and real-time
analysis

426
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:43,134
what I mean by real-time analysis

427
00:30:43,179 --> 00:30:48,220
you can write a program for example the
grounds at the top of every hour

428

using the highlighted made it here
indexation

469
00:33:39,062 --> 00:33:44,128
get campaign did out and a bit like

470
00:33:45,028 --> 00:33:48,123
for here just summer program sample
matter

471
00:33:49,023 --> 00:33:55,088
man I'm trying to pass access token
prepared the press tab

472
00:33:55,088 --> 00:33:58,126
posted to the Federer

473
00:33:59,026 --> 00:34:02,039
and get the response back and read
defection from back

474
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:07,073
session ID from their funds once I get
the fish in it.

475
00:34:07,073 --> 00:34:12,126
iPad affection I D cue get the campaign
to identify that

476
00:34:13,026 --> 00:34:16,122
get the campaign a def and forget about
running state

477
00:34:17,022 --> 00:34:22,070
possible the summer get that fought back

478
00:34:22,007 --> 00:34:26,042
next for the campaign you don't I got
and passing

479
00:34:27,005 --> 00:34:31,083
the line 95 which I want to increase the

480
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:36,088
line I T and Phoebe Mb

481
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:41,069
pasta Federer and get their funds back

482
00:34:41,069 --> 00:34:48,069
that's how simple it is to write the
programs to communicate with API

483
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:54,340
powerful secular and easy to use

484
00:34:54,034 --> 00:34:57,096
got paid out the death

485
00:34:57,096 --> 00:35:00,128
I'm going to pass on to punish to walk
us through

486
00:35:01,028 --> 00:35:04,092
what's coming next take a fresh

487
00:35:04,092 --> 00:35:07,170
think you're on the it's fascinating
what you can do with the PI's

488
00:35:08,007 --> 00:35:13,101
and how you can make by changes to your
campaigns from your own user interface

489
00:35:14,064 --> 00:35:17,070
so what's coming to spot

490
00:35:17,007 --> 00:35:21,010
so far we've talked about how I had
workbench can help you acquire new

491
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,004
customers

492
00:35:24,004 --> 00:35:28,088
but that's just half the battle for you
to grow your business

493
00:35:28,088 --> 00:35:32,121
you also need to reengage picture
existing customers

494
00:35:33,021 --> 00:35:36,084
and have them do more of what you want

495
00:35:36,084 --> 00:35:39,087
whether it's spending more time in your
app

496
00:35:39,087 --> 00:35:44,101
buy more of your products are even
trying a new app

497
00:35:45,001 --> 00:35:48,015
I came across a study recently on the
web

498
00:35:48,015 --> 00:35:51,724
by mobile analytics firm local ex which
said

499
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:54,900
22 percent of the maps that were
downloaded

500
00:35:54,009 --> 00:35:58,061
were used only once and over sixty
percent of them

501
00:35:59,042 --> 00:36:02,093
will use less than 10 less than 10 times

502
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:05,171
now you want users to frequently engage
with you up

503
00:36:06,071 --> 00:36:10,077
on your website let's take a few
examples how

504
00:36:10,077 --> 00:36:12,163
engaged to be engaged in with your
customers can help you grow your

505
00:36:13,063 --> 00:36:16,114
business

506
00:36:17,014 --> 00:36:20,100
first example is about a game app

507
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,089
see you came up with a new iPad washin

508
00:36:24,089 --> 00:36:27,110
after iPhone game

509
00:36:28,001 --> 00:36:33,072
now who would be the best customers for
this new app

510
00:36:33,081 --> 00:36:38,130
of course the user's who use that game
on the iPhone

511
00:36:39,003 --> 00:36:42,011
what if you had a way to connect

512
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:46,086
with these customers and informed them

513
00:36:46,095 --> 00:36:50,120
about your new game and what if you
could inform them

514
00:36:51,002 --> 00:36:56,090
about this new game when they're on the
iPad

515
00:36:57,008 --> 00:37:00,049
arthur you enhance your app and United
more levels

516
00:37:00,049 --> 00:37:05,117
Morgan levels are you are more things
that you wanna sell in Europe

517
00:37:06,017 --> 00:37:12,105
what if you had a way to reengage with
the user's

518
00:37:13,005 --> 00:37:16,039
and Scholl are promote these levels

519
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:20,060
only to users were beached seven levels
in a game

520
00:37:20,006 --> 00:37:24,048
a show this much in NYS only to you to
to users who actually buy merchandise

521
00:37:25,002 --> 00:37:28,004
like this

522
00:37:28,022 --> 00:37:33,027
and what about all those users who
downloaded your %ah

523
00:37:33,072 --> 00:37:36,151
but haven't used it in the last two
weeks

524
00:37:37,051 --> 00:37:40,144
what if you had a way to reconnect with
them

525
00:37:41,044 --> 00:37:44,092
and motivate them to try come back and
try your

526
00:37:44,092 --> 00:37:47,103
app again and what if you could connect
with them

527
00:37:48,003 --> 00:37:53,102
when they're not in your app let's take
another example

528
00:37:54,002 --> 00:37:57,035
a retailer see you have a regular

529
00:37:57,035 --> 00:38:00,133
now you have users who browse through
your product catalog

530
00:38:01,033 --> 00:38:05,292
and acting to the shopping basket many
of these users

531
00:38:05,589 --> 00:38:10,614
exit the app before they actually make a
purchase

532
00:38:10,839 --> 00:38:15,470
what if you had a way to find these
users

533
00:38:15,047 --> 00:38:18,083
and bring them back to finish the
purchase

534
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:22,137
and what if you could bring them back
exactly at the point where dad left

535
00:38:23,037 --> 00:38:26,103
in the shopping basket so they can
finish the transaction

536
00:38:27,003 --> 00:38:30,091
in next step

537
00:38:30,091 --> 00:38:34,098
and if you want to send offers to a
loyal customers

538
00:38:34,098 --> 00:38:37,182
what if you could show these offers deal
I'll customers irrespective of

539
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:43,146
what I was devised their own

540
00:38:44,046 --> 00:38:48,069
and for users and your customers were
items in the wish list

541
00:38:48,069 --> 00:38:52,072
what if you could reconnect with these
and inform them

542
00:38:52,072 --> 00:38:56,941
when the items and the Restless are on
sale

543
00:38:57,589 --> 00:39:00,980
now in each of these examples that we
talked about

544
00:39:00,098 --> 00:39:04,169
you talked about reconnecting with a
specific group of audience

545
00:39:05,069 --> 00:39:08,163
whether it's all the customers who have
downloaded iraq

546
00:39:09,063 --> 00:39:12,099
are the Dharma users who haven't used to
ap

547
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:16,104
are the loyal users who purchases for
you

548
00:39:17,004 --> 00:39:20,028
other users who have an abandoned car on
your shopping

549
00:39:20,028 --> 00:39:23,030
on your app be call

550
00:39:23,048 --> 00:39:27,121
these group of audiences

551
00:39:28,021 --> 00:39:35,021
segments now they're probably a million
ways you could segment audience

552
00:39:35,023 --> 00:39:38,101
you know your business and your app and
users best

553
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:43,017
so you will segment two users the way
you want it

554
00:39:43,017 --> 00:39:47,045
and for you too easily create segments

555
00:39:47,045 --> 00:39:51,139
you're introducing a new functionality
this fall with I was 8

556
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:55,103
which we call audience segmentation

557
00:39:56,003 --> 00:39:59,077
billing segments using audience
segmentation is very easy

558
00:39:59,077 --> 00:40:02,143
you could do it in just two steps

559
00:40:03,043 --> 00:40:07,076
the first one is you get segment ID's

560
00:40:07,076 --> 00:40:11,108
from Ironwood branch not every segment

561
00:40:12,008 --> 00:40:15,033
is unique so it has a unique segment ID

562
00:40:15,033 --> 00:40:18,095
you can download the segment ID's from
I'd want bans

563
00:40:18,095 --> 00:40:22,127
want to get the segment ID's you can
integrate the segment ID's

564
00:40:23,027 --> 00:40:26,080
in Iraq

565
00:40:26,008 --> 00:40:30,066
you map the user behavior are the
functionality you have in the app

566
00:40:31,038 --> 00:40:36,110
BD segment ID and when a user
demonstrates a particular user behavior

567
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:41,003
reaches the functionality city just a
particular level

568
00:40:41,003 --> 00:40:45,070
you in through my dad in a weight that
you automatically make API call

569
00:40:45,097 --> 00:40:49,135
using the new I O S it as decay

570
00:40:50,035 --> 00:40:54,039
and past that segment ID onto one page

571
00:40:54,075 --> 00:40:58,148
now when you do that your segments but
automatically start getting populated

572
00:40:59,048 --> 00:41:03,070
on i'd one-page here's an example
segmentation was done

573
00:41:03,007 --> 00:41:06,083
based on time spent in an app

574
00:41:07,046 --> 00:41:11,115
various segments users who have spent
less than one hour in the app

575
00:41:12,015 --> 00:41:15,038
1 to 10 hours 10 to 20 and 20-plus

576
00:41:15,038 --> 00:41:21,100
hours India now if you were to reconnect
re-engage with these users

577
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,069
you would probably have a very different
strategy when it comes to be engaging

578
00:41:25,069 --> 00:41:25,105
you

579
00:41:26,005 --> 00:41:29,017
with users who have spent less than out
in your app

580
00:41:29,017 --> 00:41:34,076
compared to have spent more than 20
hours

581
00:41:34,076 --> 00:41:37,108
here's another another example
segmentation is based

582
00:41:38,008 --> 00:41:42,247
on level the views

583
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:45,670
whenever you are you thirty just a
particular level

584
00:41:45,067 --> 00:41:49,088
the goal from level 1 to level 2 API
call that I talked about his

585
00:41:49,088 --> 00:41:52,146
automatically made from the client site
from your apt

586
00:41:53,046 --> 00:41:56,425
and the night segment ID's past and the
user gets added

587
00:41:56,839 --> 00:42:00,670
to this new segment so once you do
segmentation this way

588
00:42:00,067 --> 00:42:03,089
using Iowa City we can unlock

589
00:42:03,089 --> 00:42:07,142
some amazing thanks which being brings
us to the second thing that the

590
00:42:08,042 --> 00:42:09,981
increasing this fall

591
00:42:10,359 --> 00:42:14,630
because I like audience insights

592
00:42:14,063 --> 00:42:18,154
then you're segments Beach a particular
potential abusers

593
00:42:19,054 --> 00:42:23,080
even show you unique audience insights
into your segments

594
00:42:23,008 --> 00:42:26,066
all for free at no charge

595
00:42:27,038 --> 00:42:30,073
these insights are based on iTunes data

596
00:42:30,073 --> 00:42:33,662
surveys show you how the distribution as
up the users in your segment

597
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:37,880
the demographic distribution how age

598
00:42:37,088 --> 00:42:42,089
gender Houseal income distribution is
for these users

599
00:42:42,098 --> 00:42:45,937
show you the top regions the top
countries top States

600
00:42:46,819 --> 00:42:50,020
the Emmys these users come from

601
00:42:50,002 --> 00:42:53,571
the top languages these users have on
the devices

602
00:42:53,589 --> 00:42:57,310
as well as the top iTunes preferences of
these users so you know

603
00:42:57,031 --> 00:43:00,052
what are the things that really like to
download

604
00:43:00,052 --> 00:43:03,133
now once you have these unique insights
you can take some

605
00:43:04,033 --> 00:43:08,272
very tangible actions

606
00:43:08,569 --> 00:43:12,780
if you know the demographics of the
audience and in the segment

607
00:43:12,078 --> 00:43:15,099
you can find junior ap pursuit

608
00:43:15,099 --> 00:43:18,198
more of the demographics

609
00:43:19,089 --> 00:43:22,164
if you know the top regions and the
languages

610
00:43:22,839 --> 00:43:28,190
of the audience you might want to
consider localizing Europe

611
00:43:28,019 --> 00:43:31,088
if you haven't English up and you know
that the top region

612
00:43:31,088 --> 00:43:35,100
is asia-pacific and the top language is
Japanese

613
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,018
you might want to make a Japanese up

614
00:43:39,018 --> 00:43:43,927
if you created a segment of all your
lawyer users

615
00:43:44,089 --> 00:43:48,080
now you understand the characteristics
of those audience

616
00:43:48,008 --> 00:43:51,016
and then using workbench targeting you
can find

617
00:43:51,016 --> 00:43:55,695
more of the same and you can't build
your audience pool

618
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:58,880
and finally with audience segmentation

619
00:43:58,088 --> 00:44:02,110
an audience targeting together we can
bring you

620
00:44:03,001 --> 00:44:07,079
another big thing which you're also
introducing this fall

621
00:44:07,088 --> 00:44:11,027
and recall it i dnt targeting

622
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:16,980
i dnt targeting lets you re engage with
every segment that you have

623
00:44:16,098 --> 00:44:19,149
in a customized me you can give a
customer experience

624
00:44:20,049 --> 00:44:25,052
each of your segments so now you when
you had those garment users wouldn't use

625
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:27,098
your app

626
00:44:27,098 --> 00:44:30,101
you can we engage with those users with
that segment

627
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:38,001
show them a custom message motivate them
to come back and try out again

628
00:44:39,069 --> 00:44:41,930
and then you have users who have reached
a certain level and you want to push

629
00:44:41,093 --> 00:44:43,272
them to the next level

630
00:44:44,109 --> 00:44:49,010
you can create a segment of the users
who have reached a level two

631
00:44:49,001 --> 00:44:52,046
show them a custom message about love
pretty

632
00:44:52,046 --> 00:44:55,141
and engage with that take them to level
3

633
00:44:56,041 --> 00:45:00,056
not open the app deep link them

634
00:45:00,056 --> 00:45:03,071
directly to level three

635
00:45:03,071 --> 00:45:06,076
and those users who had an abandoned
card in your retail ap

636
00:45:06,076 --> 00:45:10,149
you can re-engage are retarded those
users

637
00:45:11,049 --> 00:45:14,092
irrespective of what device they are on

638
00:45:14,092 --> 00:45:17,137
and bring them back to your app

639
00:45:18,037 --> 00:45:22,216
not only bring them back deep link them

640
00:45:22,549 --> 00:45:26,710
directly to the shopping basket so the
next step

641
00:45:26,071 --> 00:45:29,137
they can finish the purchase

642
00:45:30,037 --> 00:45:34,037
so really anything is possible for each
of your segments

643
00:45:34,037 --> 00:45:37,099
you can create that awesome message

644
00:45:37,099 --> 00:45:42,138
and take the user to verify you want in
the app are given to any website

645
00:45:43,038 --> 00:45:47,039
now that's not it with the audience
retargeting

646
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:51,054
actually find those users for you

647
00:45:51,054 --> 00:45:54,099
on any I was device

648
00:45:54,099 --> 00:45:57,106
so now when you have an example that he
went to use your iPad

649
00:45:58,006 --> 00:46:01,062
ap a new app now you can find

650
00:46:01,062 --> 00:46:04,100
your iPhone app users

651
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,067
when they're on the iPad

652
00:46:08,067 --> 00:46:11,081
so what you're introducing here is a
crossed ap

653
00:46:11,081 --> 00:46:14,116
cross a device retarding

654
00:46:15,016 --> 00:46:18,675
docked is huge

655
00:46:18,819 --> 00:46:21,867
what is unique about this the first
thing is

656
00:46:22,299 --> 00:46:25,370
automation that comes with it

657
00:46:25,037 --> 00:46:28,056
when you both segments using I was 8

658
00:46:28,056 --> 00:46:32,147
your segments are automatically updated
in real time

659
00:46:33,047 --> 00:46:36,091
no more of manually harvesting idea
phase

660
00:46:36,091 --> 00:46:39,750
sharing them with your network partners

661
00:46:40,569 --> 00:46:44,750
your data is most secure when it's in
one place

662
00:46:44,075 --> 00:46:48,144
and there's no better place an Apple
iPad but you create segments

663
00:46:48,819 --> 00:46:51,823
this me same addition is automated

664
00:46:51,859 --> 00:46:54,930
audience insights run based on
segmentation

665
00:46:55,569 --> 00:46:59,770
that the Obama updated as well as the
audience retarding

666
00:46:59,077 --> 00:47:02,090
is updated in real time

667
00:47:02,009 --> 00:47:05,057
the next thing as privacy

668
00:47:06,038 --> 00:47:10,093
audience to be targeting and the Sendai
solution be talked about

669
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:13,117
is deeply integrated with the IRS

670
00:47:14,017 --> 00:47:17,052
you get all the benefits of the built-in
privacy controls

671
00:47:17,052 --> 00:47:22,076
that comp the solutions complies with
the limit at tracking

672
00:47:22,076 --> 00:47:25,112
so now if you have a user who has limit
at tracking

673
00:47:26,012 --> 00:47:29,231
on but use that is removed automatically

674
00:47:29,339 --> 00:47:33,416
from the segments so the user is not
retarded

675
00:47:34,109 --> 00:47:39,250
everything is automated you have nothing
to worry about

676
00:47:39,025 --> 00:47:43,124
so with the audience segmentation
audience insights

677
00:47:44,024 --> 00:47:48,028
an audience to targeting I had becomes
I'd workbench

678
00:47:48,028 --> 00:47:51,081
becomes a complete solution you cannot

679
00:47:51,081 --> 00:47:54,125
only for acquire new users a new
customers

680
00:47:55,025 --> 00:47:58,634
you can now understand your existing
users

681
00:47:58,859 --> 00:48:02,750
and he engaged with them to grow your
business

682
00:48:02,075 --> 00:48:06,083
what is coming will be introducing to
new ad formats

683
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:09,090
this phone interstitial ads

684
00:48:09,009 --> 00:48:13,018
we can also call is full screen banners
and medium rectangle

685
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:16,183
article as and Rec bodies ad formats

686
00:48:17,083 --> 00:48:20,102
will be available on iPad as well as on
iPhone

687
00:48:21,002 --> 00:48:25,017
soviet-backed you'll have for at formats
to choose

688
00:48:25,017 --> 00:48:28,065
banner ads video ads

689
00:48:28,065 --> 00:48:31,152
and officials an Amtrak

690
00:48:32,052 --> 00:48:36,149
the next is gonna continue enhancing the
I had were bent API's

691
00:48:37,049 --> 00:48:40,146
willing to use I don't want API 2.0
which will give you a full

692
00:48:41,046 --> 00:48:45,058
read/write campaign creation capability

693
00:48:45,058 --> 00:48:48,103
so if you work with a demand-side
partner article as DSP

694
00:48:49,003 --> 00:48:53,087
you can now have your DSP plug into I'd
workbench

695
00:48:53,087 --> 00:48:56,104
and create and manage campaigns on your
behalf

696
00:48:57,004 --> 00:49:01,011
from the own you I an interface that's a
move to words programed buying

697
00:49:01,074 --> 00:49:05,081
automated way of booking campaigns and
managing them

698
00:49:05,081 --> 00:49:08,570
from your own UI blood supply to APIs
for segmentation that we talked about

699
00:49:09,299 --> 00:49:09,980
Justin

700
00:49:09,098 --> 00:49:12,957
a little bit ago and finally be
continued that you expansion

701
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:17,600
be going more countries and then as but
would think that we have in plans for

702
00:49:17,006 --> 00:49:19,070
you

703
00:49:20,024 --> 00:49:23,099
suitors to summarize you use at the sign
the demos in Troy the talk

704
00:49:23,099 --> 00:49:28,198
i'd workbenches the simplest way for you
to reach Apple users

705
00:49:29,089 --> 00:49:32,310
it's very powerful and it's open to
everyone

706
00:49:32,031 --> 00:49:35,040
so if you haven't tried workbench yet

707
00:49:35,004 --> 00:49:38,056
go to i'd workbench for Apple dot com
and login

708
00:49:38,092 --> 00:49:42,156

the new art form at the probable down
and coming in phone

711
00:49:49,609 --> 00:49:54,680
and finally the key thing make sure you
enable you up

712
00:49:54,068 --> 00:49:59,247
