1
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:13,048
hi

2
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:15,102
hope hope you all a good lunch

3
00:00:16,002 --> 00:00:19,027
the section 220 adopting advanced
features on the new UI

4
00:00:19,027 --> 00:00:22,059
and Mac OS 10 yosemite on I'm Chris
treason

5
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:26,061
and the let me start by showing off some
others new

6
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:29,127
UI features in Yosemite so

7
00:00:30,027 --> 00:00:33,028
up to be in with your the a simple
Finder window

8
00:00:33,028 --> 00:00:36,060
and the big changes to your house the
doc is kind of

9
00:00:36,006 --> 00:00:39,097
just grabbing the color from the desktop
picture likewise

10
00:00:40,051 --> 00:00:44,077
the Finder sidebar is infused with the
the bright pinks and oranges

11
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:47,089
on the desktop picture and it's really
complimenting

12
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:50,096
do users content on-screen are

13
00:00:50,096 --> 00:00:54,101
likewise we have a picture above Safari
here

14
00:00:55,001 --> 00:00:58,014
and the continent harmonies radovan
Finder window

15
00:00:58,014 --> 00:01:02,067
but a the toolbar is is just grabbing
that color from the web page

16
00:01:02,067 --> 00:01:05,126
and making the you I really really
complement the

17
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:09,940
the web content here and %uh finally

18
00:01:09,094 --> 00:01:12,172
we have Notification Center arm which
has been around

19
00:01:13,072 --> 00:01:16,168
a little while now but in Yosemite you
can see it's using the

20
00:01:17,068 --> 00:01:20,141
whatever you occurrences and its point
up the the really bright reds and

21
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:22,119
oranges and yellows from the desktop
picture

22
00:01:23,019 --> 00:01:26,038
and it's not just the background of the
Texas pointed out the buns are pulling

23
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:26,890
it up

24
00:01:26,089 --> 00:01:30,108
and we're gonna show you how to build
you eyes that also grab color from the

25
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:32,010
environment like this

26
00:01:32,001 --> 00:01:36,610
a so to start with I'm gonna mention a
few

27
00:01:36,709 --> 00:01:40,709
changes in existing acted API's
especially in this car and its image

28
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:43,717
then ima spend while talking about a
title bars and toolbars

29
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:48,970
section I like to call pile apartment to
a farce and a

30
00:01:48,097 --> 00:01:52,114
after the alibi Corbin on stage to talk
about some

31
00:01:53,014 --> 00:01:57,633
important new classes that allow you to
use these visual effects

32
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,830
particular bill that we like to refer to
as Byron C and

33
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:04,136
finally will top it off with the
discussion performance regarding these

34
00:02:05,036 --> 00:02:05,043
new effects

35
00:02:06,006 --> 00:02:09,059
about to begin reviewing our

36
00:02:09,059 --> 00:02:12,083
are all the Bugatti API's the

37
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:15,822
this is Anna segment control in Yosemite
arm

38
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:20,840
you'll notice the be a finder in the
background in this picture so far in for

39
00:02:20,084 --> 00:02:20,119
round

40
00:02:21,019 --> 00:02:24,051
near the back four controls on these are
separate elements now

41
00:02:24,051 --> 00:02:27,066
but they're not actually separate as
controls

42
00:02:27,066 --> 00:02:31,073
this is the same in a segment rose
always we just configured it that

43
00:02:32,036 --> 00:02:33,054
segment style property

44
00:02:33,054 --> 00:02:37,127
with a new value the and a segment style
enumeration has been augmented with Anna

45
00:02:38,027 --> 00:02:39,050
segments I'll separated

46
00:02:39,005 --> 00:02:41,092
and this gives you the destroyed
appearance between the back and forward

47
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:42,091
buttons

48
00:02:42,091 --> 00:02:45,177
so when you're up K that parents don't
throw to Aspen's at

49
00:02:46,077 --> 00:02:51,109
just using a segmented control and the
senate segment style a

50
00:02:52,009 --> 00:02:55,050
so I like to talk about and its image
now on

51
00:02:55,005 --> 00:02:57,068
especially if you've been using you I am
and will be familiar with some other

52
00:02:58,013 --> 00:02:58,111
things I'm talking about

53
00:02:59,011 --> 00:03:02,056
but a was to start with this little
sample image here

54
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:05,144
just kind of a button or about your
background of some sort and if you tried

55
00:03:06,044 --> 00:03:09,052
to stretch it using the SMS GTI ring I
put in as an interview where you draw

56
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:10,088
yourself

57
00:03:10,088 --> 00:03:13,136
you're going to notice the image is
stretched uniformly

58
00:03:14,036 --> 00:03:17,077
so the corners here the store as the
image is resized

59
00:03:17,077 --> 00:03:20,082
and thats kind of neat but if we're
going for a button

60
00:03:21,027 --> 00:03:24,099
or window background it's not really
affect me one and

61
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:27,130
you images had this for quite a few
releases

62
00:03:28,003 --> 00:03:31,069
a but an estimate now joins it in
introducing the captain sets property

63
00:03:31,096 --> 00:03:34,150
and the stakes in a sentence that struck
thank you thank you

64
00:03:35,005 --> 00:03:39,063
ok States and its agents that's trucked
which lets you specify the

65
00:03:40,008 --> 00:03:43,033
distance to the edges to make these caps
and

66
00:03:43,033 --> 00:03:46,034
those Capen sets are in the image court
system

67
00:03:46,043 --> 00:03:49,095
serve you the NS image court system
begins at a

68
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:52,187
are 00 in the lower left him in size and
height the right their way

69
00:03:53,087 --> 00:03:56,090
he said the captain sat on an image and
wrought like used to resize

70
00:03:57,017 --> 00:04:00,063
you know we're now holding the edges and
corners

71
00:04:00,063 --> 00:04:03,142
constant while resizing the interior the
image so this lets you get the

72
00:04:04,042 --> 00:04:04,136
stretchable buttons

73
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:09,135
the stretchable backgrounds a quite
easily I

74
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:12,459
there's one other thing I want to
mention about this up

75
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:15,550
so again if you're familiar with you I
am and you know the you a matter sizing

76
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:15,092
mode

77
00:04:15,092 --> 00:04:18,591
we now have an asymmetry sizing mode
which offers traction tile options

78
00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:22,503
stretched the fall it back to the
behavior we've used a Mac OS 10

79
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:27,220
pretty much forever now tiles a new
option and these are exposed on the

80
00:04:27,022 --> 00:04:27,118
surprisingly named

81
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:31,033
resizing Road property on its image
thank you got

82
00:04:31,033 --> 00:04:35,040
a so as an example here the senator
sizing mode the tile

83
00:04:35,004 --> 00:04:39,047
and a you know doesn't quite do justice
as across the here but you can see how

84
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:41,089
the image is actually being piled into
these larger sizes

85
00:04:42,043 --> 00:04:45,121
so if you have interesting detail you
don't want stretched you want replicated

86
00:04:46,021 --> 00:04:46,027
and said

87
00:04:46,081 --> 00:04:49,280
this is how you would pull it off and
you can use it with any s binder nans

88
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:51,240
ImageView

89
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:55,533
arm so to set up the slicing you buy
part you have your programmatically now

90
00:04:55,749 --> 00:04:59,490
but you can also do this with Xcode and
to do that you just open your image

91
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:02,438
your ass a cataloging a nice preview of
it here here's that might 9 slice

92
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:05,885
checkerboard image and you can set this
up using the

93
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,560
ID inspector in this area here we've got
the

94
00:05:10,056 --> 00:05:13,565
the slicing motyar horizontal and
vertical here for nine slicing mention

95
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:15,085
of the 23 sliced

96
00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:18,620
horizontal to vertical on

97
00:05:18,062 --> 00:05:22,071
and if you want to change the tiling
mode we have the structures option here

98
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:26,310
so you can do that graphically without
ever having to change your code

99
00:05:26,949 --> 00:05:29,830
that covered in this image I like to
mention a few things about and its

100
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:32,722
appearance in Yosemite

101
00:05:33,469 --> 00:05:36,547
so s appearances in a county had
Richardson maverick's

102
00:05:37,249 --> 00:05:40,610
I we offer to a appearances and
maverick's

103
00:05:40,061 --> 00:05:43,090
which you can get out using the
appearance named class method

104
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:47,360
on the ass appearance class and a

105
00:05:47,036 --> 00:05:51,025
the default is and as a parent same aqua
which is what we use forever we continue

106
00:05:51,349 --> 00:05:52,412
to use it as the default the parents

107
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:55,982
and we have this other parents are
called as a parent's name light content

108
00:05:56,009 --> 00:05:57,900
which is used by pop overs

109
00:05:57,009 --> 00:06:00,118
and in Yosemite we are saying goodbye

110
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:04,037
to write content don't use that anymore
instead

111
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:08,352
pop overs use one of our new parents
names which is by bright lights

112
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:12,300
and byron dark and poor man's gonna talk
a lot about these and his section

113
00:06:12,003 --> 00:06:14,712
but let me just give you a preview of
what these look like we have byron white

114
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:15,930
on the left

115
00:06:15,093 --> 00:06:19,202
and byron dark on the right you can see
how the background in the elements are

116
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:22,123
bike with pulling up that color from
beneath the window in this case and how

117
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:23,882
the house image

118
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:28,550
is is much more offers much more
contrast against that background

119
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:31,124
and I'm I did before assignments and
color here

120
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:34,983
so probably won't surprise anyone to
know that and a scholar has some notable

121
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,214
mentions here

122
00:06:37,349 --> 00:06:40,411
about the day one is that system colors
are appear insensitive suffused by Matt

123
00:06:40,969 --> 00:06:41,973
later by been dark

124
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:45,210
the system colors are going to return
different effective values

125
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:48,470
so something called the things I control
background color control text color

126
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:53,080
there's dozens more arm there in the and
a scholar header and the documentation

127
00:06:53,008 --> 00:06:56,008
we also have to new system colors

128
00:06:56,008 --> 00:07:00,557
and that's label color and secondary
label color and a Corbin will also

129
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,650
talk about these in-depth

130
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:07,300
alright my favorite section here title
bars and toolbars

131
00:07:07,003 --> 00:07:10,031
we're all familiar with handle bars and
toolbars but

132
00:07:10,058 --> 00:07:13,146
in Yosemite they have a new default
appearance and one of the key elements

133
00:07:14,046 --> 00:07:18,645
that new default appearance is that they
blur document content

134
00:07:19,059 --> 00:07:23,710
so up here's a slightly awkward video of
me scrolling a picture in preview

135
00:07:23,071 --> 00:07:27,140
and you can see that I scroll the title
bar in tow bar are actually absorbing

136
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:28,818
and boring that content

137
00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:32,244
in real time and a preview didn't have
to do anything two-game this they they

138
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:33,490
got that

139
00:07:33,049 --> 00:07:36,121
feature for free up let me explain how
that

140
00:07:37,021 --> 00:07:40,033
that works so if you have a ScrollView

141
00:07:40,033 --> 00:07:44,582
and its adjacent your title bar Toolbar
we're going to automatically drawl that

142
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,110
that previously obscure content and
would work for you

143
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:52,720
if you're ScrollView isn't adjacent to
the title bar we're going to ignore it

144
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:55,520
C&C on the left that kinda made a
mock-up showing that the title bar

145
00:07:55,052 --> 00:07:57,058
blurring that orange document content

146
00:07:57,058 --> 00:08:00,083
and on the right it's not adjacent to
the title bar so we're not boring at

147
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:03,232
were absorbing at all and that works
really well

148
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:08,930
for almost all content out there but
there's a few cases I want to call out

149
00:08:08,093 --> 00:08:12,142
where are magic there can use a little
bit help

150
00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:16,054
so what are those is movie news

151
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:19,807
this is a big area where we can Tucson
Medical replicate the content for you

152
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:25,512
likewise opens your views are in a
similar place

153
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:27,542
you may notice kinda
hardware-accelerated thing going on

154
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:29,050
using the Jeep you

155
00:08:29,005 --> 00:08:32,039
and that's a good observation some types
of players

156
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:35,878
also need a little bit helping users
movie layers and open Joe layers kinda

157
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:37,760
grandfathered in with the views

158
00:08:37,076 --> 00:08:41,080
but other things like a layers with 3d
transforms and layers with core image

159
00:08:41,008 --> 00:08:41,092
filters

160
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:45,953
also require little bit of help to show
up in the title bar and pool bar

161
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:49,940
let me show you how you can do that

162
00:08:49,094 --> 00:08:52,168
we have to play some there explicitly
and we can do this using this new window

163
00:08:53,068 --> 00:08:57,073
style mask called NS full-size content
the window mask

164
00:08:57,073 --> 00:09:00,151
on as a simple them up by threw together
this is using a

165
00:09:01,051 --> 00:09:04,094
asylum after does not include the full
size cotton you flag

166
00:09:04,094 --> 00:09:07,135
and you can see our content view is
vertically beneath the title bar and

167
00:09:08,035 --> 00:09:08,106
pool bar

168
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:13,013
and this content you just has a slightly
odd red box and black box

169
00:09:13,076 --> 00:09:16,082
if we add the full size Khan a new
window mask

170
00:09:16,082 --> 00:09:20,148
also on the the content the size hasn't
changed but I Warenkorb are overlaid on

171
00:09:21,048 --> 00:09:22,131
top of that content you can see a boring

172
00:09:23,031 --> 00:09:26,032
the red and the black in the title bar
there

173
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:29,072
so if you look at this mockup used
before size content you

174
00:09:29,072 --> 00:09:33,103
when no mask a problem notices that
those controls you used have the top of

175
00:09:34,003 --> 00:09:34,057
your window

176
00:09:34,057 --> 00:09:37,086
are still at the top of your window but
the title bar

177
00:09:37,086 --> 00:09:41,097
overlays them and unless you're trying
to play a very

178
00:09:41,097 --> 00:09:43,191
interred at mine game with your user and
if you are your job is done

179
00:09:44,091 --> 00:09:45,123
congratulations

180
00:09:46,023 --> 00:09:49,105
you're going to want to figure out a way
to you get your controls to be anchored

181
00:09:50,005 --> 00:09:54,043
at the bottom of the title bar again and
probably the easiest way to do this

182
00:09:54,043 --> 00:09:57,050
is by using auto layout so

183
00:09:58,013 --> 00:10:01,087
and its window offers a new property
called content layout died

184
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:04,128
and this returns an object to that you
can use

185
00:10:05,028 --> 00:10:08,031
a layout constrain just like you would
use an ass few

186
00:10:08,058 --> 00:10:11,085
the example here and creating a
constraint which binds the top of my

187
00:10:11,085 --> 00:10:11,163
view

188
00:10:12,063 --> 00:10:15,100
to the top of the windows content layout
guide and that means that the the top

189
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,068
corner to both our views is going to be
at the same place in the window

190
00:10:18,068 --> 00:10:21,079
while at least them out arm

191
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:24,160
if you're not using a laptop sorry a we
have a new API

192
00:10:25,006 --> 00:10:29,020
yosemite gonna layout constraints called
the active property

193
00:10:29,074 --> 00:10:32,112
and you can now install constrain just
by sending to be active

194
00:10:33,012 --> 00:10:36,048
you don't need to find a common ancestor
at at the constraint few

195
00:10:36,048 --> 00:10:40,080
up constrained to in this case the
content lab guide doesn't necessarily

196
00:10:40,008 --> 00:10:41,060
have a common ancestor

197
00:10:42,032 --> 00:10:45,088
and this API takes care of it for you

198
00:10:45,088 --> 00:10:48,107
if you're not using our way out we have
another property for you

199
00:10:49,007 --> 00:10:52,030
called content layout wrecked and that's
just an ass wrecked that

200
00:10:52,003 --> 00:10:55,042
represent the on obscure area up the
window

201
00:10:55,069 --> 00:10:58,104
a its key value observing compliant

202
00:10:59,004 --> 00:11:01,090
which means if you register as a
key/value observer for you're gonna get

203
00:11:01,009 --> 00:11:02,014
called back when it changes

204
00:11:03,004 --> 00:11:07,035
and that's important because it can
change the title bar can change height

205
00:11:07,071 --> 00:11:10,139
the toolbar have items added or removed
or labels out and move you know from

206
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:12,046
small icon to large I come out

207
00:11:13,009 --> 00:11:17,048
so it's important to be aware and
assuming we use one of those methods we

208
00:11:17,048 --> 00:11:18,116
can outweigh our buttons

209
00:11:19,016 --> 00:11:22,029
beneath the title by the way they want
their accessible to the user again

210
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:25,032
but the scroll view presents kinda
challenge force

211
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:29,153
we wanted to start of on obscured by the
title bar and we don't want the scroller

212
00:11:30,053 --> 00:11:33,116
to be upskirt obscured by the title bar
either however if we just leave the

213
00:11:34,016 --> 00:11:35,022
scroll the US position that

214
00:11:35,076 --> 00:11:40,094
to take up the entire hi to the content
view it will be so in a way to fix that

215
00:11:40,094 --> 00:11:43,121
and we have a way to fix that we have a
new API

216
00:11:44,021 --> 00:11:48,026
on a ScrollView called content and sets
and this just adds margins

217
00:11:48,026 --> 00:11:52,032
are around a ScrollView where we'll
inset the content you

218
00:11:52,032 --> 00:11:56,107
arm ok so in this example I'm using the
content lautrec property at the window

219
00:11:57,007 --> 00:12:00,104
and the windows frame to infer the
offset between the top of the window

220
00:12:01,004 --> 00:12:04,081
and the top in the content area I just
gone ahead and set a content and sets

221
00:12:04,081 --> 00:12:06,157
where its top property is equal to that
of Sep

222
00:12:07,057 --> 00:12:10,076
there's an easier way of doing this if
you do this you're going to keep values

223
00:12:10,076 --> 00:12:12,142
are the content where a property knows
when it changes

224
00:12:13,042 --> 00:12:17,042
and a ScrollView also offers a boolean
called automatically adjust content and

225
00:12:17,042 --> 00:12:18,056
sets

226
00:12:18,056 --> 00:12:21,087
and he set the stage yes it will
automatically

227
00:12:21,087 --> 00:12:24,181
mu are up adjuster content for the
scroller isn't obscured by the title bar

228
00:12:25,081 --> 00:12:29,090
and the content itself will start on
obscured by the title bar

229
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:32,070
so we had back are all summer for
example here this is how the window look

230
00:12:33,051 --> 00:12:33,086
like

231
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:36,175
up when it opened by the user when they
began scrolling

232
00:12:37,075 --> 00:12:40,144
the scroll Yukon against all slide under
the title bar just the way we want

233
00:12:41,044 --> 00:12:44,052
and we can get this a its appearance
love blurring the document content at

234
00:12:45,024 --> 00:12:45,121
the title bar

235
00:12:46,021 --> 00:12:50,082
without packet replicating it for you

236
00:12:50,082 --> 00:12:53,131
a for like to take a yr trying another
screenshot here the picture

237
00:12:54,031 --> 00:12:58,031
Safari and some your note about knows
about it is that

238
00:12:58,031 --> 00:13:01,036
the title of the window isn't there
instead the window with its on the

239
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:01,087
toolbar

240
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:06,050
share the same row likewise here's a
picture up maps

241
00:13:06,005 --> 00:13:09,076
it's doing a similar thing notice the
the title bars grabbing that content

242
00:13:10,021 --> 00:13:10,116
from

243
00:13:11,016 --> 00:13:15,042
the window again but it's also leaving
out the title in the window

244
00:13:15,042 --> 00:13:18,046
so you want to do this in your app's
it's not difficult

245
00:13:18,082 --> 00:13:21,105
we have a new generation called and
that's when the title visibility

246
00:13:22,005 --> 00:13:25,046
has three states visible hidden hidden
one active

247
00:13:25,046 --> 00:13:28,107
a in one active adds a little bit of
context so windows in the background the

248
00:13:29,007 --> 00:13:30,026
title comes back

249
00:13:30,026 --> 00:13:33,029
that can distinguish it from other why
some more windows

250
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:37,125
arm these are settable through the ass
window title visibility property

251
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:41,099
so stupid example here's that Finder
window again this is titled visible

252
00:13:41,099 --> 00:13:44,116
and you can see it has a separate row
for the widgets in the title followed by

253
00:13:45,016 --> 00:13:47,039
the to walk

254
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:50,071
whereas as well the title hidden it's
gone the title bar

255
00:13:50,071 --> 00:13:53,080
the titles Don the window which is in
the toolbar share the same row

256
00:13:54,061 --> 00:13:57,068
here's another picture this is a an app
called reminders if you if you didn't

257
00:13:57,068 --> 00:13:58,094
know this was our miners

258
00:13:58,094 --> 00:14:01,097
there's a hint the top a

259
00:14:01,097 --> 00:14:04,105
but you can see the windows divided into
two sections they have a

260
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:08,125
a sidebar that runs all the way from the
bottom of the window

261
00:14:09,025 --> 00:14:12,047
to the top of the window we all know the
sidebars not being blurred by the title

262
00:14:12,047 --> 00:14:12,081
bar

263
00:14:12,081 --> 00:14:16,085
ok likewise here's a picture notes and
they're in a similar thing

264
00:14:17,021 --> 00:14:20,067
the the note on the right actually has a
size paper texture to it and that paper

265
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,156
texture goes all the way to the top of
the window again

266
00:14:23,056 --> 00:14:26,108
and %uh this is also easy to accomplish
a and this window

267
00:14:27,008 --> 00:14:30,010
has a new property call title barker's
transparent

268
00:14:30,028 --> 00:14:34,071
so if we go back to my silly little red
box black box example

269
00:14:34,071 --> 00:14:36,165
this is that went idle workers
transparent Eagles know and thats the

270
00:14:37,065 --> 00:14:37,128
fall

271
00:14:38,028 --> 00:14:43,075
so you can see the title bars boring or
content with a TS

272
00:14:43,075 --> 00:14:47,075
the a the red box in the black box are
obscure so you can do tricks like could

273
00:14:47,075 --> 00:14:49,162
use that go all the way from the bottom
of the window to the top

274
00:14:50,062 --> 00:14:53,129
on or otherwise augment the title bar

275
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:58,043
so I'd like to invite corman on stage
he's going to talk about some new API's

276
00:14:58,043 --> 00:15:01,043
that let you take advantage of our
visual fax especially one

277
00:15:01,043 --> 00:15:04,045
call Byron C welcome carbon thanks Chris

278
00:15:04,045 --> 00:15:08,051
so my name's Corbin and I'm not get
software engineer

279
00:15:08,051 --> 00:15:12,082
so bottom and talk about today I'm gonna
talk about a new class apk it

280
00:15:12,082 --> 00:15:15,150
to do these boring visual effects called
in a special affect you

281
00:15:16,005 --> 00:15:19,036
my talk about his appearance and some
materials and how to get that

282
00:15:19,081 --> 00:15:23,115
custom colors and whatnot that we have
democrat about piracy in how to get that

283
00:15:24,015 --> 00:15:24,094
apartment E

284
00:15:24,094 --> 00:15:27,113
and how doing your controls has gone to
control the napkin

285
00:15:28,013 --> 00:15:31,091
and finally my discussed briefly some
the standard controls in at K

286
00:15:31,091 --> 00:15:35,106
that dot these creatures and how we
doing how it affects you

287
00:15:36,006 --> 00:15:40,017
so personal let's jump right and and go
to a demo

288
00:15:40,017 --> 00:15:44,060
this demo is called visual fact
playground and it's not an actual

289
00:15:44,006 --> 00:15:48,020
playground ap like you might think back

290
00:15:48,074 --> 00:15:51,149
what has here's shows a lot of features
that I'm going to discuss today

291
00:15:52,049 --> 00:15:56,055
there are a lot of buttons this app and
the show he's thing that I talk about

292
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:59,123
search in the developer site free
assembly for visual fact playground

293
00:16:00,023 --> 00:16:03,069
you can find this taken apart and play
around and figure out how to create ap

294
00:16:03,069 --> 00:16:04,097
psych this

295
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:07,123
something that as if I click when these
images here iShares Dow

296
00:16:08,023 --> 00:16:13,049
how to create basically your own type a
sidebar I do some Byron C

297
00:16:13,049 --> 00:16:16,135
there's a couple examples and how do
some type of blurring with an app Skype

298
00:16:17,035 --> 00:16:18,063
application

299
00:16:18,063 --> 00:16:23,097
how to get them we're here and also a
blender the tile bar to

300
00:16:23,097 --> 00:16:26,146
another one showing off our dark look to
and how do you do something similar to

301
00:16:27,046 --> 00:16:29,081
what they stand as

302
00:16:29,081 --> 00:16:32,082
so these new visual effects I'm and talk
about new class called

303
00:16:32,082 --> 00:16:35,149
individual back to you and here's a
screenshot of it and we see that

304
00:16:36,049 --> 00:16:39,130
its blending with step behind the window

305
00:16:40,003 --> 00:16:43,018
there's no screenshot that demo
application and its planning with stuff

306
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:45,091
inside the window

307
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:48,175
and now this is an important difference
to note because we have two concepts

308
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:49,130
here

309
00:16:50,003 --> 00:16:53,095
we have behind 10 blending where with
whatever's behind the fuel behind the

310
00:16:54,022 --> 00:16:55,047
window is blended with

311
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:59,144
what you see we have in window blending
so they're two different modes for this

312
00:17:00,044 --> 00:17:03,088
and so that's reflected in the API
France visual affect you

313
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:06,397
there's an genome individual effect
blending mode

314
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:10,264
and has two options planning mode behind
window and

315
00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:15,630
a blending mode within window and their
property said

316
00:17:15,063 --> 00:17:18,102
so you can just set in code or

317
00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:21,723
you can open up here at application
inside

318
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:26,220
your face builder and you can go ahead
and set the blending mode directly here

319
00:17:26,022 --> 00:17:31,058
truly easy to do get that behind window
where and when to when

320
00:17:31,058 --> 00:17:34,119
so how does this work how does the
behind window blending

321
00:17:35,019 --> 00:17:39,083
actually behave and what does it do well
our implementation is ing

322
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:42,122
for graphics in the Windows Server this
means that as your window is moving

323
00:17:43,022 --> 00:17:43,105
around

324
00:17:44,005 --> 00:17:47,005
now the content years in your Windows
actually read wrong

325
00:17:47,005 --> 00:17:50,061
its manage for you automatically bar
Windows Server

326
00:17:50,061 --> 00:17:54,127
what is visual effect you guys the kind
to find regions with the Windows Server

327
00:17:55,027 --> 00:17:58,093
the tally hey this is the area that I
want to be vibrant or two people heard

328
00:17:58,093 --> 00:18:01,097
and do it automatically division affect
you

329
00:18:02,033 --> 00:18:05,069
also implement fire in C numba discuss
about that

330
00:18:05,069 --> 00:18:08,154
in detail in a little bit

331
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:12,148
cell one thing to note about this and
the visual thank you with behind when

332
00:18:13,048 --> 00:18:13,107
opening

333
00:18:14,007 --> 00:18:18,009
whatever is behind your view entire
application is going to be

334
00:18:18,009 --> 00:18:22,014
poked out were knocked out so glad to
have you inside my window

335
00:18:22,014 --> 00:18:25,095
thanks on top of an image you a picture
this elephant its gonna poke out

336
00:18:25,095 --> 00:18:26,117
whatever is behind it

337
00:18:27,017 --> 00:18:31,046
and so it kinda just just just knocks it
out said something to be aware of

338
00:18:31,046 --> 00:18:34,059
in your application

339
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:37,115
saw how does within window blending work

340
00:18:38,015 --> 00:18:42,021
within 10 blending utilizes for
animation to achieve this effect

341
00:18:42,075 --> 00:18:45,173
as visual effects you is a special
where's special filters to do this

342
00:18:46,073 --> 00:18:50,073
work behind the scenes quite missions
also used implement the vibrancy which

343
00:18:50,073 --> 00:18:53,079
I'll talk about more in a little bit

344
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:59,040
now if it is in Coronation and you set
the property to be with and window

345
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:02,053
it requires their backing and so this is
a screenshot

346
00:19:02,089 --> 00:19:05,154
what happens they're faced over if you
don't have it where backed in a show it

347
00:19:06,054 --> 00:19:06,082
as

348
00:19:06,082 --> 00:19:09,158
red 10k hey you're doing something wrong
major prime make it where backed

349
00:19:10,058 --> 00:19:14,061
but you probably don't wanna make just
your visual fact you

350
00:19:14,088 --> 00:19:18,097
the thing that's where backed you wanna
make the thing that contains it

351
00:19:18,097 --> 00:19:21,135
be there back so in this case the
content do you ever wonder would be the

352
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,089
thing that you make their back

353
00:19:23,089 --> 00:19:26,508
because it needs to be when those things
together and they both the coronation

354
00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:27,740
where's

355
00:19:27,074 --> 00:19:31,096
in order to achieve that

356
00:19:31,096 --> 00:19:34,141
so how can he said it well you can also
set

357
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:39,062
I dis easily inside a tax code

358
00:19:39,062 --> 00:19:42,114
if you don't to encode for the once
there a kiss check that box

359
00:19:43,014 --> 00:19:48,060
enough merit that's been around for a
while cremation there

360
00:19:48,006 --> 00:19:51,037
now let me talk about some state the
visual effect you has

361
00:19:51,091 --> 00:19:55,160
inactive state which we see here
blending with the wind up

362
00:19:56,006 --> 00:19:59,055
and it also has in on key or inactive
stay

363
00:20:00,009 --> 00:20:04,078
so I'm actually removes the blurring and
just goes to being a solid color

364
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:08,124
fell this is also represent an API

365
00:20:09,024 --> 00:20:13,025
so the visual effect few has property
called state

366
00:20:13,025 --> 00:20:16,834
and it's in the new value and its visual
back state

367
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:20,920
and has as visual effects state follows
window active state

368
00:20:20,092 --> 00:20:23,123
which is probably what you want to do
what this means is

369
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:28,028
when your Windows key and Windows Active
that visual effect you will be key an

370
00:20:28,028 --> 00:20:28,090
active

371
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:31,016
but you may want to control more
explicitly seeking expert with that

372
00:20:32,006 --> 00:20:33,017
active state

373
00:20:33,071 --> 00:20:36,079
works closely set to inactive state

374
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:39,161
and actually have for powerful control
over this

375
00:20:40,061 --> 00:20:43,128
now the things about that as I said
before you want probably always use the

376
00:20:44,028 --> 00:20:44,086
followers

377
00:20:44,086 --> 00:20:48,114
went to active state value because when
it becomes key and ninety

378
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:52,060
are automatically do the work for you
and you have to do anything

379
00:20:52,006 --> 00:20:55,022
want to use the active state explicitly
very sparingly

380
00:20:55,076 --> 00:20:58,090
it can affect performance and battery
life because if you have a lot of visual

381
00:20:58,009 --> 00:21:01,023
factories around there always active

382
00:21:02,004 --> 00:21:04,086
but you pry want to use in places where
you know that you is always going to be

383
00:21:04,086 --> 00:21:04,179
active

384
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:08,085
and maybe it's a panel that can become a
key for whatever reason

385
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,066
internally we use in things like pop
overs and sheets which always want how

386
00:21:12,066 --> 00:21:15,162
that particular look

387
00:21:16,062 --> 00:21:20,115
so that was discussing some basic
properties official affect you

388
00:21:21,015 --> 00:21:24,082
now let me discuss how to set the
material and how it works with in

389
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:24,175
disappearance

390
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:28,089
and issue of fact you itself

391
00:21:28,089 --> 00:21:31,092
as Chris mentioned here are two
screenshots showing

392
00:21:32,019 --> 00:21:36,025
two different parents is we happy in its
appearance name by Brightlight

393
00:21:36,025 --> 00:21:40,072
get it to get this light appearance I'm
like controls

394
00:21:40,072 --> 00:21:43,100
and we have disappearance same byron
dark to get the dark look

395
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,014
and dark appearance knows the controls
automatically look different

396
00:21:48,014 --> 00:21:53,053
and automatically are changing the
colors as needed

397
00:21:53,053 --> 00:21:56,145
easy to do this you can just use visual
fact few doubt appearance

398
00:21:57,045 --> 00:22:00,046
and set the appearance to either firing
like her firing dark

399
00:22:00,046 --> 00:22:03,085
can do it in code very simple or

400
00:22:03,085 --> 00:22:07,162
as usual you can go into Interface
Builder selective visual affect you

401
00:22:08,062 --> 00:22:11,127
and when you select the visual effect
you they parents

402
00:22:12,027 --> 00:22:15,119
property when I have vibrant light and
Barb dark is options

403
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:19,026
other views won't have this option so
the

404
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:23,134
vibrant appearances work wire in this
issue of fact you

405
00:22:24,034 --> 00:22:27,107
I'm gonna say more about this and that
why

406
00:22:28,007 --> 00:22:31,080
that visual effect fuking be a direct
ancestor

407
00:22:31,008 --> 00:22:34,012
perhaps to be a direct ancestor have
your child abuse

408
00:22:34,084 --> 00:22:37,095
in order to get the vibrant a look and
Barbuda fact

409
00:22:37,095 --> 00:22:40,183
however whatever material shown by the
visual effect on you

410
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:44,151
maybe different than what their parents
Assange

411
00:22:45,051 --> 00:22:48,086
and let me describe that a little bit
differently

412
00:22:48,086 --> 00:22:53,087
visual effect you has a property called
material

413
00:22:53,087 --> 00:22:56,171
in a special effect material has several
Union values

414
00:22:57,071 --> 00:23:00,169
the first one is what you will probably
use the majority the time

415
00:23:01,069 --> 00:23:04,080
in this visual effect material
appearance-based

416
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:07,095
so let me show you how that one works

417
00:23:08,067 --> 00:23:11,091
if you have a visual effect on you and
it's set to

418
00:23:11,091 --> 00:23:16,091
NS issue of fact mature appearance-based
the actual material shown by the visual

419
00:23:16,091 --> 00:23:16,158
fact you

420
00:23:17,058 --> 00:23:20,114
is on a Mac be determined by their
parents

421
00:23:21,014 --> 00:23:24,067
said he set the vibrant light appearance
the material light

422
00:23:24,067 --> 00:23:28,112
will appear for that matter of fact you
set the vibrant dark parents

423
00:23:29,012 --> 00:23:32,079
immaterial dark walk here for the visual
fact you

424
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:35,123
now you can explicitly set the material
and not set their parents which is why

425
00:23:36,023 --> 00:23:37,092
didn't you know option

426
00:23:37,092 --> 00:23:41,095
so the last option here is in this
visual fact material

427
00:23:41,095 --> 00:23:44,104
title bar that's what this material is
for

428
00:23:45,004 --> 00:23:48,065
is for you to create your own had a bar
like views

429
00:23:48,065 --> 00:23:51,099
so you may have a need in your
application to replicate that had a bar

430
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:51,170
that we do

431
00:23:52,007 --> 00:23:56,736
inside pocket and we just use this this
issue of equity up at a bar internally

432
00:23:57,429 --> 00:24:01,442
and so you can also use it to create
your own had a bars if you need to

433
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:05,850
are so that was discussing visual effect
you appearance

434
00:24:05,085 --> 00:24:10,107
and some other materials so now my talk
about vibrancy and cut some controls

435
00:24:11,007 --> 00:24:14,009
first serve all what is a vibrancy

436
00:24:14,027 --> 00:24:17,050
and byron she is just basically a
special blend were taking

437
00:24:17,005 --> 00:24:20,082
two different pixels combine them
together getting a different result that

438
00:24:21,027 --> 00:24:21,098
works

439
00:24:21,098 --> 00:24:24,173
more vibrant when the combined together
its bankruptcy just

440
00:24:25,073 --> 00:24:28,146
abstract term that week winding up kid
and that we don't have to worry about

441
00:24:29,046 --> 00:24:30,089
the actual implementation

442
00:24:30,089 --> 00:24:34,089
the actual implementation and blending
we do could be when your burn

443
00:24:34,089 --> 00:24:39,111
a collar dodge by Steve Purcell it
doesn't matter reps tracking it for you

444
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:44,036
but if you don't know what those terms
mean let me give an example

445
00:24:44,036 --> 00:24:47,065
so cures just a simple image have some

446
00:24:47,065 --> 00:24:50,161
flowers and if I drop it low square on
to it

447
00:24:51,061 --> 00:24:54,120
it's just the skies are grey square with
that doctor border

448
00:24:55,002 --> 00:24:59,008
and if I set to be color burned are you
can see it looks more vibrant

449
00:24:59,026 --> 00:25:02,057
so effectively this is what we're doing
to our controls and this is just a very

450
00:25:02,057 --> 00:25:03,286
simple example

451
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:07,874
what color burn and what we mean by
vibrancy

452
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:11,650
so how does this work with visual fact
few

453
00:25:11,065 --> 00:25:14,108
and how does the attacks become vibrate

454
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:18,054
let's take a look at at what you have to
do

455
00:25:18,054 --> 00:25:21,098
for small in order to get any sort by
twenty you have to use the vibe in

456
00:25:21,098 --> 00:25:22,107
appearance

457
00:25:23,007 --> 00:25:27,011
they have to set the fire right reviving
dark parents an environment she is

458
00:25:27,011 --> 00:25:30,083
on Mactan abstractly applied

459
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:33,182
so for this low piece a text here

460
00:25:34,082 --> 00:25:37,166
in order to get this text to look
vibrant and it might be difficult to see

461
00:25:38,066 --> 00:25:41,149
but it is actually blending with the
conference behind the window

462
00:25:42,049 --> 00:25:47,054
you just use and a scholar label color
and it looks more like a bird

463
00:25:47,054 --> 00:25:50,120
you may also have a need for a secondary
vibrant look

464
00:25:51,002 --> 00:25:55,016
and this one just slightly lighter and
looks a little bit different

465
00:25:55,034 --> 00:25:58,373
and again we have a new collar and ask
our secondary label color

466
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:04,150
to achieve this vibrancy in in this text
field

467
00:26:04,015 --> 00:26:07,050
now let me remind you about some
template images

468
00:26:07,005 --> 00:26:10,054
you may or may not be aware that in this
image has had at

469
00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:14,570
a template property sense 10:05 and it's
really simple

470
00:26:14,057 --> 00:26:17,079
you can't create your image as a black
and white image

471
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:21,144
and due Sept yes we have a specific
naming convention to make a template

472
00:26:22,044 --> 00:26:25,049
I get your company image where we can
apply a tax on top and inside

473
00:26:25,094 --> 00:26:29,136
apk it so if you're using a template
image

474
00:26:30,036 --> 00:26:33,070
in this image you automatically apply
vibrancy

475
00:26:33,007 --> 00:26:36,101
so here's an example have a regular
image

476
00:26:37,064 --> 00:26:41,473
not a template image and I'm athlete
does not have RNC

477
00:26:42,049 --> 00:26:46,070
however at this image below I'm at the
has I fancy

478
00:26:46,007 --> 00:26:49,090
because it's using a temp damage so if
you in your application

479
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:52,102
use temple images can harm at to get
vibrancy

480
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:56,086
so that big the question was how does
something like image you

481
00:26:57,013 --> 00:27:00,078
say hey I want to be vibrant or not the
vibrant and how is it dynamically

482
00:27:00,078 --> 00:27:02,227
chooses answer

483
00:27:02,929 --> 00:27:06,950
and the answer is we have new a API in
and ask you to do this

484
00:27:06,095 --> 00:27:09,166
and this is basically the implementation
inside this image you

485
00:27:10,066 --> 00:27:15,071
it says allows vibrancy is the new API
anti-cancer to allow tyrants he is

486
00:27:16,016 --> 00:27:19,069
South the image that is template
purchasing hey if I'm a template

487
00:27:19,069 --> 00:27:22,073
I can be vibrant I'm not template i
campi fiber

488
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:26,110
very simple so you may be wondering then

489
00:27:27,001 --> 00:27:31,010
well how do i signal to the system that
that's change with my answers

490
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,072
changing based on something that I said
I change the image or what not

491
00:27:35,072 --> 00:27:39,138
and just like normal ap get things if
you change the state a vibrancy or need

492
00:27:40,038 --> 00:27:40,137
the question to be

493
00:27:41,037 --> 00:27:44,069
and asked you again just cost that needs
display

494
00:27:44,069 --> 00:27:51,069
and on that the call back and update the
vibrancy effect for your view

495
00:27:52,015 --> 00:27:55,028
now in this text field also is vibrant

496
00:27:55,028 --> 00:27:58,110
his text field he's a very similar to
end this image you

497
00:27:59,001 --> 00:28:03,002
and it answers yes to allow siren T if
you're using their particular vibrant

498
00:28:03,011 --> 00:28:03,107
colors

499
00:28:04,007 --> 00:28:07,033
so if you're inside the fire in
appearance and using label color

500
00:28:07,033 --> 00:28:11,262
secondary label color or any other
colors which might be custom for that

501
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:12,530
appearance

502
00:28:12,053 --> 00:28:16,115
he will probably appear vibrant feed
don't want to text appear by bring

503
00:28:17,015 --> 00:28:20,090
you need to explicitly opt out by
setting the control

504
00:28:20,009 --> 00:28:23,288
pack scholar or some other color that's
not there

505
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:28,278
in its appearance also has a method
called allows haven't seen on it

506
00:28:29,169 --> 00:28:32,280
this is using API and no effort
officially

507
00:28:32,028 --> 00:28:35,927
particular appearance needs by means
you're not we discussed more about this

508
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:37,960
in detail later

509
00:28:37,096 --> 00:28:41,114
but what this kansas is it gives us a
recipe

510
00:28:42,014 --> 00:28:46,022
to let new know when a particular view
is going to be a vibrant

511
00:28:46,022 --> 00:28:50,077
any view will be vibrant if all these
conditions up here true

512
00:28:50,077 --> 00:28:54,124
the appearance has to say yes from
allows vibrancy which means currently

513
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:58,593
that it's the virus like retiring dark
appearance

514
00:28:58,809 --> 00:29:01,840
your view subclass has to override
allows vibrancy

515
00:29:01,084 --> 00:29:04,137
and say yes have used expressing that it
can be vibrant

516
00:29:05,037 --> 00:29:09,336
and that viewer has to be inside the
visual fact you

517
00:29:09,669 --> 00:29:13,707
the visual effect US order that the glue
that binds it all together

518
00:29:14,049 --> 00:29:18,160
if it's not contained inside official
affect you arms he will not work

519
00:29:18,016 --> 00:29:22,110
when all these conditions are met you
control will become vibrant

520
00:29:23,001 --> 00:29:26,004
so let's talk about custom controllers
and vibrancy what you can do in your

521
00:29:26,013 --> 00:29:26,096
control

522
00:29:26,096 --> 00:29:29,305
to make them buy right so here we have

523
00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:33,460
a custom view it's just drawing a

524
00:29:33,046 --> 00:29:36,075
gray awful and then another great on one
side a bit

525
00:29:36,075 --> 00:29:40,088
and this was appearing vibrant you can
see how it's deeper orange collar

526
00:29:40,088 --> 00:29:45,887
graze being blended with what's behind
the window produces vibrant a fact

527
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:50,280
and went not individual back to you that
same exact heel

528
00:29:50,028 --> 00:29:53,084
is drawing on vibrantly is trying its
normal great colors

529
00:29:53,084 --> 00:29:56,141
with no work from you developer in
addition

530
00:29:57,041 --> 00:30:01,089
and everything to play on this to you
this bottom view here

531
00:30:01,089 --> 00:30:04,186
it is inside the visual affect you yet
it's not appearing by Bert

532
00:30:05,086 --> 00:30:09,089
I discuss how to achieve that affect you
in a short bit

533
00:30:09,089 --> 00:30:12,171
how do you actually go ahead and
implement this well for some all

534
00:30:13,071 --> 00:30:16,150
in your cutting the subclass as I
mentioned before you overwrite allows

535
00:30:17,005 --> 00:30:17,684
vibrancy

536
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:21,700
and your pie return yes that way when
you're in a buyer in appearance

537
00:30:21,007 --> 00:30:25,056
you on that they will appear vibrant and
then inside you draw a racket pages do

538
00:30:26,019 --> 00:30:27,098
whatever you're doing today

539
00:30:27,098 --> 00:30:30,172
you sector particular colors fill up our

540
00:30:31,072 --> 00:30:34,161
or do whatever type ad wrong you want an
alarm ACK to become vibrant

541
00:30:35,061 --> 00:30:38,134
sure I'm just wrong with some regular
callers have

542
00:30:39,034 --> 00:30:42,034
variation in black with a different how
to value

543
00:30:42,034 --> 00:30:46,112
and this few on Mac it becomes byron

544
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:52,020
now because I Q says yes to allows
vibrancy anything drawn in fact that he

545
00:30:52,002 --> 00:30:52,035
will

546
00:30:52,053 --> 00:30:55,128
automatically become by rent even if you
do images

547
00:30:56,028 --> 00:30:59,030
any taxed any caller everything inside
it will be vibrant

548
00:30:59,048 --> 00:31:02,090
you don't have to use label color or
secondary label color

549
00:31:02,009 --> 00:31:06,043
to get vibrancy and that you

550
00:31:07,024 --> 00:31:11,049
however what you can do as you can
utilize named system collars

551
00:31:11,049 --> 00:31:14,108
to have your application haircuts and
you be more dynamic

552
00:31:15,008 --> 00:31:19,099
depending on what kind appearances and
its ally to parents are darker periods

553
00:31:19,099 --> 00:31:22,174
suffering through something like and its
color control text color now is

554
00:31:23,074 --> 00:31:26,143
dark when it's on a light appearance and
light

555
00:31:26,809 --> 00:31:29,890
and inside dark appearance

556
00:31:29,089 --> 00:31:32,128
something to be aware if you're taking
these colors and storing them in your

557
00:31:32,929 --> 00:31:34,953
apt store the name collar

558
00:31:35,169 --> 00:31:39,490
don't convert that car to a CD color or
don't compare it to a color space

559
00:31:39,049 --> 00:31:42,058
don't extract RGB elements and save them
off because if you do that

560
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:46,127
you lose that dynamic nature of the
color instead to save the color

561
00:31:47,027 --> 00:31:50,032
itself like to ask our control X color
and utilize it

562
00:31:50,032 --> 00:31:55,251
again and again now again if you change
your parents on a particular view

563
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:59,460
I automatically knowledge the sub use so
you're calling on TAC color

564
00:31:59,046 --> 00:32:05,145
not to worry about balloting things is
that automatically

565
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:08,840
so let's take a look at some code that
uses a system color because you may not

566
00:32:08,084 --> 00:32:09,108
be familiar with that

567
00:32:10,008 --> 00:32:13,036
we have colorless and sinking easily
grab

568
00:32:13,036 --> 00:32:16,059
a colorless name system and what the
sample code

569
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:21,148
is doing and again this is providing
that demo application mentions the start

570
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,220
its gonna go and septum attributes can
you read through all the colors in the

571
00:32:25,022 --> 00:32:26,024
car list

572
00:32:26,024 --> 00:32:30,033
grabbed a clear color out Bayside ski
accuse the name in the collar

573
00:32:30,033 --> 00:32:34,050
US at a bit and just do a wreck still to
fill that color

574
00:32:34,005 --> 00:32:37,070
one after another so if we look at a few

575
00:32:38,015 --> 00:32:41,076
where all its doing is drying the
scholars and this looks very

576
00:32:41,076 --> 00:32:44,122
very I busy so let me explain it

577
00:32:45,022 --> 00:32:49,022
this is what we would get this is what
that day my application does so in the

578
00:32:49,022 --> 00:32:50,091
first column

579
00:32:50,289 --> 00:32:53,294
this is just wrong the name a particular
color

580
00:32:53,789 --> 00:32:57,710
next column is drawing day same color
same to you

581
00:32:57,071 --> 00:33:02,148
in the Aqua appearance same color same
unify reply to parents

582
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:06,094
same color and same to you in the
vibrant darker parents

583
00:33:06,094 --> 00:33:09,176
and if resume and say can see one
particular row this is the control text

584
00:33:10,076 --> 00:33:10,147
color

585
00:33:11,047 --> 00:33:14,376
as you can see there aqua every lighten
dark dark

586
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:18,980
the collars are all slightly different
depending on what we decide apt-get

587
00:33:18,098 --> 00:33:22,111
to make it look for particular parents
way here they are different

588
00:33:23,011 --> 00:33:26,057
thing on your parents so if we take a
look at that

589
00:33:26,057 --> 00:33:31,101
custom view again that was drawing the
circles if you use his car label color

590
00:33:32,001 --> 00:33:35,095
is color secondary level color that you
would look good

591
00:33:35,095 --> 00:33:38,157
if it's an ally to parents or darker
parents without you having to do

592
00:33:39,057 --> 00:33:40,076
anything

593
00:33:40,076 --> 00:33:43,745
now one thing snow in his view at that
bottom there is

594
00:33:44,429 --> 00:33:48,160
one is custom views that's not trying
privately 208

595
00:33:48,016 --> 00:33:51,019
opt-out a vibrancy and what did it do

596
00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:55,066
it's very simple all that view is doing
and this is just an inside Interface

597
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:56,445
Builder you can do in code

598
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:01,100
as I haven't selected and I glance at
their parents back to Aqua

599
00:34:01,001 --> 00:34:05,004
ok and so it no longer meets the
criteria being a pirate control

600
00:34:05,013 --> 00:34:10,012
and it won't drive I really

601
00:34:10,129 --> 00:34:13,450
so the things to note: is that you can
opt out a particular controls from

602
00:34:13,045 --> 00:34:13,774
vibrancy

603
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:17,195
one at a time or you can do I believe
you are key

604
00:34:17,339 --> 00:34:20,363
cicada harkin controls opt in or out by
setting

605
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:23,656
I can't air to be want to take their
parents or not

606
00:34:24,349 --> 00:34:27,970
not in and out dipping what you need

607
00:34:27,097 --> 00:34:30,306
one thing to know is your view

608
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:34,810
that's apparent can't have already said
yes to allow tyrants a

609
00:34:34,081 --> 00:34:40,190
because there are caveats with that
which I will discuss in a little bit

610
00:34:40,919 --> 00:34:44,210
let's discuss how you would actually
achieve something like this

611
00:34:44,021 --> 00:34:48,960
where the same to you words individual
affect your draws one way

612
00:34:49,149 --> 00:34:53,149
and went in the regular aqua appearances
try another way in this case

613
00:34:53,149 --> 00:34:57,320
went in the Aqua parents and drying red
and purple Justin be dramatically

614
00:34:57,032 --> 00:34:58,068
different

615
00:34:58,068 --> 00:35:02,074
so why would you wanna do this well in
application my want provide

616
00:35:02,074 --> 00:35:07,100
different artwork for when you're inside
a vibrant vibe in appearance

617
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,049
than when you're not have I been
appearance and when you're inside her

618
00:35:11,049 --> 00:35:11,100
regular

619
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,093
aqua appearance or you can use different
collars

620
00:35:15,093 --> 00:35:18,159
or something or something along that
line in this particular case

621
00:35:19,059 --> 00:35:23,095
I'm just using different colors it's
really easy to use

622
00:35:23,095 --> 00:35:27,114
as I mentioned before in disappearance
has a allows vibrancy

623
00:35:28,014 --> 00:35:31,023
property and its yes when it's in the
lab in appearance

624
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:35,081
and Serco kinky of that in this view has
a method

625
00:35:35,081 --> 00:35:38,085
caught active appearance where it find
out what

626
00:35:39,021 --> 00:35:42,077
the parents set on it or somewhere up
the chain

627
00:35:42,077 --> 00:35:46,089
and you can query that and see if it
allows haven't see and if it does

628
00:35:46,089 --> 00:35:49,091
it's that one particular color if it
doesn't you can send our caller

629
00:35:50,009 --> 00:35:53,056
so here's just saying the red car when
it's in not an apartment

630
00:35:53,056 --> 00:35:59,071
parents so let me discuss some have
yachts with vibrancy and lending

631
00:35:59,071 --> 00:36:02,970
this is the within 10 blending mode and
some caveats with it

632
00:36:03,609 --> 00:36:07,030
so let's say that we have this superb
you here

633
00:36:07,003 --> 00:36:11,028
the one with the grace their darker
square around it

634
00:36:11,028 --> 00:36:16,029
and has some seventies not that super
view says yes to allows vibrancy

635
00:36:16,038 --> 00:36:19,527
what's going to happen is all this abuse
are going up

636
00:36:19,869 --> 00:36:23,410
always be vibrant and so it's a little
difficult to see here

637
00:36:23,041 --> 00:36:26,067
but now that sub you that image you

638
00:36:26,067 --> 00:36:29,154
is doing a different blending it looks a
little bit murky muddy

639
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:35,142
because it's doing a fire in planning
and thats not desired

640
00:36:36,042 --> 00:36:40,118
so thing to be aware of here is if your
custom view is returning yes from allows

641
00:36:41,018 --> 00:36:42,030
carbon C

642
00:36:42,003 --> 00:36:45,552
all your stuff he is going to be a
vibrant so if you're designing

643
00:36:45,849 --> 00:36:49,849
applications you need to keep this in
mind and design are some used to be a

644
00:36:49,849 --> 00:36:54,800
my written and or or to be aware that
they're going to be vibrant

645
00:36:54,008 --> 00:36:58,013
were designed it so much that your
parent view is not saying yes to ours

646
00:36:59,003 --> 00:37:00,007
having tea

647
00:37:00,034 --> 00:37:05,098
overlapping with the siblings our
children

648
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:08,099
there also some other caveats with
behind 10 blending

649
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:11,128
has that same once vibrant always
battling a fact

650
00:37:12,028 --> 00:37:16,124
but there's an additional problem here
than going to highlight

651
00:37:17,024 --> 00:37:20,043
and wet is happening here is have this

652
00:37:20,043 --> 00:37:24,075
little box which is saying no I don't
want vibrancy

653
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:27,149
however there's a text field on side of
it which is using label color

654
00:37:28,049 --> 00:37:32,141
which as you can know from before saying
yes to allowed piracy

655
00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:37,134
say tax 13 vibrant but the thing drum
behind wants to not be vibrant

656
00:37:38,034 --> 00:37:42,313
are those areas are overlapping we just
described this to the Windows Server

657
00:37:42,619 --> 00:37:45,710
and so what's going to happen is
anything in that square the tax

658
00:37:45,071 --> 00:37:48,073
is going to be vibrant including what
was drawn behind it

659
00:37:48,073 --> 00:37:52,116
that blue area and so it gets also
vibrancy apply today

660
00:37:53,016 --> 00:37:56,041
so this is another caveat what you
should be aware and

661
00:37:56,041 --> 00:38:00,078
and not do instead taiwan architects to
not be vibrant

662
00:38:00,078 --> 00:38:03,120
or how that will control to be firing so
everything is Iran

663
00:38:04,002 --> 00:38:09,028
another thing that we have is visual
effect you can have a mask image

664
00:38:09,046 --> 00:38:10,088
property

665
00:38:10,088 --> 00:38:13,317
the mask image all you can ask it

666
00:38:14,109 --> 00:38:17,760
right here to visual effect is one is
the light appearance climate Iran are

667
00:38:17,076 --> 00:38:18,158
used in a dark material

668
00:38:19,058 --> 00:38:23,119
if i said im asking me johnnie to them
chest area blending behind it

669
00:38:24,019 --> 00:38:27,102
to behind the window is only inside that
mask area

670
00:38:28,002 --> 00:38:32,081
say just see that for the actual house
icon where the gear icon

671
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:35,560
and what was drawn in the window you can
now see the poppy flower

672
00:38:35,056 --> 00:38:39,099
and again had em up occasion shows this

673
00:38:39,099 --> 00:38:43,104
you can easily set a mask image or you
can use and its image image resize

674
00:38:44,049 --> 00:38:47,063
and do the block and already created on
the fly

675
00:38:47,063 --> 00:38:50,082
to hear sending it to be a as a power

676
00:38:50,082 --> 00:38:54,121
just around wreck and when you do
something like this

677
00:38:54,859 --> 00:38:58,260
it's how you would achieve this shown in
the demo app works around wreck

678
00:38:58,026 --> 00:39:03,071
mind our window using them mask image
property

679
00:39:03,071 --> 00:39:06,149
some notes about mask image Chris
highlighted some the new features

680
00:39:07,049 --> 00:39:11,083
that we use with an S image so you know
set as captains had taken properly

681
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:12,166
structured mask image

682
00:39:13,066 --> 00:39:16,079
and everything worked fine

683
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,167
okay so that was discussing visual
effect for you mask image

684
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:23,140
appearance and how to get piracy when we
talk about

685
00:39:24,004 --> 00:39:27,043
love our standard controls napkin how
they do vibrancy

686
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:30,103
and things to be aware of for small

687
00:39:31,003 --> 00:39:36,332
cable viewing outlined you and came here
now I'm you configured as a source list

688
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:40,490
is automatically opting into a farm in
appearance now

689
00:39:40,049 --> 00:39:43,117
they see that something like the sidebar
and male

690
00:39:44,017 --> 00:39:47,216
calendars et cetera

691
00:39:47,369 --> 00:39:51,980
so how does this work and has worked
with your applications already

692
00:39:51,098 --> 00:39:54,174
appears in the selection high lifestyle
have NSW selection

693
00:39:55,074 --> 00:39:58,157
Alex dow source list that tells the
table well im view that

694
00:39:59,057 --> 00:40:02,131
it wants to BS West list and essays you
set that

695
00:40:03,031 --> 00:40:07,036
either in code for an air base builder
it is always had side effects

696
00:40:07,081 --> 00:40:11,100
and these are documenting the release
notes but I'm gonna reiterate come here

697
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,026
out llanview's indentation is on Mac be
affected in control

698
00:40:15,026 --> 00:40:18,048
to meet specific metrics new 10/10

699
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:21,050
we start tweaking the inner cellspacing
just slightly to make it meet new

700
00:40:21,068 --> 00:40:22,076
metrics

701
00:40:23,048 --> 00:40:26,081
if you think it will sell view its
position and imagery and texture I'm at

702
00:40:26,081 --> 00:40:28,370
the control to where it needs to be

703
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:32,310
and we apply actually for the tax to
make it appear cracked

704
00:40:32,031 --> 00:40:35,108
so if your application is using a source
list I like before and didn't make any

705
00:40:36,008 --> 00:40:39,091
significant changes though I make to get
the new tent and look for source this

706
00:40:39,091 --> 00:40:42,098
in sidebar the latter but here is

707
00:40:42,098 --> 00:40:45,127
background-color: for the actual source
list for the table

708
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:49,044
is set to a magical internal color

709
00:40:49,044 --> 00:40:52,080
it's important to be aware of this

710
00:40:52,008 --> 00:40:55,042
because it has magical color what's
happening

711
00:40:56,014 --> 00:41:00,058
inside a bad kid when we see that you're
using that special background-color:

712
00:41:00,058 --> 00:41:04,337
we're gonna go ahead and put a visual
effect you behind your table view

713
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:09,490
and do the blurring automatically for
you see you don't have to do anything

714
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:13,066
you don't want that behavior after you
set this lecture highlights out the

715
00:41:13,066 --> 00:41:14,015
source list

716
00:41:14,609 --> 00:41:17,700
you can change the background color
anything else he could change it back to

717
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:17,069
clear

718
00:41:18,032 --> 00:41:21,053
what to nothing and it will not do the
operation

719
00:41:21,053 --> 00:41:24,612
and this is the way it's always worked
and so we respect or behavior

720
00:41:25,089 --> 00:41:28,090
opting out about our phone caller white
background blur

721
00:41:28,099 --> 00:41:31,410
say could do it manually and some other
super view if you need to for some

722
00:41:31,041 --> 00:41:33,990
reason

723
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:39,250
now the No or thing to be aware of is
now on Mac the intent and

724
00:41:39,025 --> 00:41:42,118
the sidebar so restless for cable
viewers on a Mac to get there appearance

725
00:41:43,018 --> 00:41:44,026
set to the vibrant light appearance

726
00:41:44,098 --> 00:41:48,191
for you and you don't have to do that

727
00:41:49,091 --> 00:41:53,104
now the control inside pocket popover is
now utilizing

728
00:41:54,004 --> 00:41:57,081
the light at like Dark Materials as
necessary

729
00:41:57,081 --> 00:42:01,083
and it will have its appearance at the
barber like or vibrant dark as necessary

730
00:42:02,001 --> 00:42:05,082
and you have to do anything for that

731
00:42:05,082 --> 00:42:08,120
soap that was an overview the standard
app controls

732
00:42:09,002 --> 00:42:13,076
and sad about get I'm gonna bring back
to Chris to talk more about performance

733
00:42:13,094 --> 00:42:16,131
and we can do to make ya pass with these
new visual fax:

734
00:42:17,031 --> 00:42:20,033
thank you for it alright that was fun

735
00:42:20,051 --> 00:42:23,139
talk about performance which is also fun
so we're

736
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:28,518
you notice that blur we had and this may
not surprise you

737
00:42:28,869 --> 00:42:33,190
a but the perfect isn't exactly free it
does cost something

738
00:42:33,019 --> 00:42:36,096
and that something is graphics
performance and battery usage

739
00:42:36,096 --> 00:42:41,097
and the sometimes though the cost is
worth the results

740
00:42:42,006 --> 00:42:46,024
so something you should be aware appears
you're not trying to not use this affect

741
00:42:46,024 --> 00:42:47,065
you wanna wrap up utiful

742
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:49,143
you just need to pay attention to
striking a balance between that

743
00:42:50,043 --> 00:42:50,121
appearance

744
00:42:51,021 --> 00:42:55,066
and the resource utilization so here's a
small example these two

745
00:42:55,066 --> 00:42:58,131
images on the left and right appeared
that was actually control with reimage

746
00:42:59,031 --> 00:42:59,810
views

747
00:43:00,089 --> 00:43:03,089
and these byron template houses and

748
00:43:03,089 --> 00:43:06,380
requirements requires a visual effect
you so there's actually

749
00:43:06,038 --> 00:43:10,039
a few ways of accomplishing this but on
the left

750
00:43:10,039 --> 00:43:14,039
which is to accomplish this with a
single visual effect you

751
00:43:14,039 --> 00:43:17,138
meanwhile on the right we can accomplish
this with three visual effects use

752
00:43:18,038 --> 00:43:21,052
and there some obvious reasons the
structure things on the right person

753
00:43:21,052 --> 00:43:21,128
left

754
00:43:22,028 --> 00:43:24,100
one that would be flexibility if you
need a different appearances are

755
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,006
different materials

756
00:43:26,006 --> 00:43:29,079
for this house on the right you need is
visual effect is however

757
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:32,170
a you should be cautious about how many
visual effect is using and when you're

758
00:43:33,007 --> 00:43:34,008
using them

759
00:43:34,008 --> 00:43:37,053
in this case the number of pixels
affected here the surface area of these

760
00:43:38,025 --> 00:43:38,089
houses

761
00:43:38,089 --> 00:43:41,103
is almost identical between the left and
the right

762
00:43:42,003 --> 00:43:46,018
and in that case a single visual effect
you is going to be more performance

763
00:43:46,018 --> 00:43:49,018
there's less information for us to track
a

764
00:43:49,018 --> 00:43:52,447
the option in this case is also true if
you had a window with say some very

765
00:43:52,609 --> 00:43:54,632
small areas %uh vibrancy

766
00:43:54,839 --> 00:43:57,900
and there are different and in the
window it might be more efficient use to

767
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,022
visual effect use

768
00:43:59,003 --> 00:44:02,029
and set up a single enormous official
affect you

769
00:44:02,029 --> 00:44:05,071
something else to be aware of especially
for in 10 colors

770
00:44:05,071 --> 00:44:08,083
is frequently updated content on what I
am back from the updated content

771
00:44:08,083 --> 00:44:12,095
well I mean Louise I'm animations I even
mean blinking cursor

772
00:44:12,095 --> 00:44:16,140
arm these are gonna be updating at 2430
tips or 63 animation

773
00:44:17,004 --> 00:44:20,443
or even to fit circling Kercher's and
the thing is whenever these update

774
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:24,390
we're going to have to re computer a
blur this is also true

775
00:44:24,039 --> 00:44:27,068
for behind window blurs but you don't
usually control the content behind the

776
00:44:27,068 --> 00:44:30,154
window in your apt so that's not
something you really need to worry about

777
00:44:31,054 --> 00:44:34,078
a Corbin mention that layers are often
required

778
00:44:34,078 --> 00:44:37,647
a especially for and window bars and
later usage is increasing just

779
00:44:38,349 --> 00:44:41,740
in general a but something I want to
mention is that

780
00:44:41,074 --> 00:44:45,117
if you're using layers the dirty shapes
on screen are any different

781
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:50,018
then if you're not using layers so
here's an example love a mock text you

782
00:44:50,027 --> 00:44:52,123
that just blinks and insertion point and
this this %ah rectangle

783
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:57,049
when it's not later backed and you can
see here we we have this

784
00:44:57,049 --> 00:45:00,054
waking cursor well you probably can't
see is I've actually it turned on color

785
00:45:00,099 --> 00:45:01,167
flush in one of our debug tools

786
00:45:02,067 --> 00:45:06,073
and this rectangle is turning yellow
every time the cursor updates

787
00:45:06,073 --> 00:45:09,081
a for not only are back to you that
small rectangle is all that's left on

788
00:45:10,053 --> 00:45:11,118
screen

789
00:45:12,018 --> 00:45:15,024
if however we r we say we do want to
wear for this we're still using the

790
00:45:15,078 --> 00:45:16,113
small to redirect

791
00:45:17,013 --> 00:45:21,018
but whatever the view updates we see
this instead

792
00:45:21,063 --> 00:45:24,152
the entire layers flushed it's not that
we're trying anymore our application is

793
00:45:25,052 --> 00:45:27,121
still just drawing that tiny purse a
wreck

794
00:45:27,589 --> 00:45:31,150
it's just that poor animation has been
built for GPUs to involve summit in

795
00:45:31,015 --> 00:45:32,080
geometry in large batches

796
00:45:32,008 --> 00:45:35,056
so we just watch the entire contents
layer to the screen

797
00:45:36,028 --> 00:45:39,101
if for example you had a visual effect
you that overlaid the right side of this

798
00:45:40,001 --> 00:45:43,099
this view even though only the insertion
point are insertion point on the left is

799
00:45:43,099 --> 00:45:43,958
blinking

800
00:45:44,849 --> 00:45:48,800
that blurs gonna have to be re computed
so that is something

801
00:45:48,008 --> 00:45:51,033
keep in mind com something else to
beware of

802
00:45:52,005 --> 00:45:54,794
if you're using update where are you
have your own where tree in your setting

803
00:45:54,839 --> 00:45:58,390
your own their properties like the
corner radius or other ailments directly

804
00:45:58,039 --> 00:46:01,130
will the entire layer still gonna be
flush in one on one pass their

805
00:46:02,003 --> 00:46:06,015
so that caveat applies update where
users also

806
00:46:06,042 --> 00:46:09,139
often though you can fix this by just
three factor in your view here he first

807
00:46:10,039 --> 00:46:13,122
for a little so for example if you're
frequently updating content

808
00:46:14,022 --> 00:46:17,070
try to put it in a small view and have
reserve large news

809
00:46:17,007 --> 00:46:20,896
for static or and frequently updated
content

810
00:46:21,589 --> 00:46:25,664
from an unrelated but very important to
be aware an S 10 has no pic property

811
00:46:26,339 --> 00:46:29,416
and you shouldn't mess with it if using
Visual Effects use in the past if you

812
00:46:30,109 --> 00:46:32,720
needed to punch a hole through your
window or have transparency you had to

813
00:46:32,072 --> 00:46:32,125
set the stage

814
00:46:33,025 --> 00:46:36,032
yes however if you're using Visual
Effects use you don't have to do that we

815
00:46:36,095 --> 00:46:37,754
take care of it automatically

816
00:46:38,609 --> 00:46:41,790
he said this to know you're gonna take
away a lot of information the Windows

817
00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:42,088
Server users

818
00:46:42,088 --> 00:46:45,182
to call obscured Windows and it'll be
doing a lot more dry in the necessary

819
00:46:46,082 --> 00:46:51,084
so avoid this unless you're already
using it for other reasons

820
00:46:52,002 --> 00:46:55,065
on I want to point out this option and
the accessibility preference

821
00:46:55,065 --> 00:46:58,082
this in the display subsection called
this transparency

822
00:46:58,082 --> 00:47:01,121
and that'll actually turn off or blurs
on a system-wide basis

823
00:47:02,021 --> 00:47:07,400
and I'm not suggesting this as a user
feature in 72 just as a diagnostic tool

824
00:47:07,589 --> 00:47:10,615
if you add a lot of visual effect just
your app and all the sudden notice that

825
00:47:10,849 --> 00:47:14,900
made your window resize animations are
four screen transitions have become slow

826
00:47:14,009 --> 00:47:17,073
you can set this to yes and the so avoid
the cost

827
00:47:18,054 --> 00:47:21,103
WEA we pay it when doing that were

828
00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:24,617
so if you notice when this is turned on
your performance is fine

829
00:47:24,869 --> 00:47:28,580
with turned off performance is kinda
sluggish it's probably

830
00:47:28,058 --> 00:47:32,114
you're using a visual effects that's too
large or too many visual effect use

831
00:47:33,014 --> 00:47:37,025
and that's a cute dial down the the
transparency and boring

832
00:47:37,025 --> 00:47:40,064
in the app some other things I want to
mention

833
00:47:40,064 --> 00:47:43,102
is a to perform its all good news for
this

834
00:47:44,002 --> 00:47:47,006
so I used courts debug Torana up

835
00:47:47,006 --> 00:47:50,008
coloring and dirty areas that the
Windows Server had to redraw and that

836
00:47:50,026 --> 00:47:53,385
can be very useful for diagnosing cases
where you may be drawing more content

837
00:47:53,619 --> 00:47:54,570
than you're expecting

838
00:47:54,057 --> 00:47:56,153
or when you're using layers and you're
drawing a little bit of content but it's

839
00:47:57,053 --> 00:47:57,141
affecting entire

840
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:02,750
you something wanna point out about a
lot of are trying here is that

841
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:06,140
the perfect actually happens out a
process that happens in the Windows

842
00:48:06,329 --> 00:48:08,530
Server and furthermore happens on the
Jeep you

843
00:48:08,053 --> 00:48:11,138
and that means that profiling your own
process won't necessarily tell you as

844
00:48:12,038 --> 00:48:13,071
much as you would hope

845
00:48:13,071 --> 00:48:16,073
I'm store ever going to call out the
instrument store

846
00:48:16,073 --> 00:48:20,182
because the the Windows Server and your
app archive competing to get frames on

847
00:48:20,839 --> 00:48:23,250
the screen in a single display cycle

848
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:26,114
and at the faster you can make your app
in the letter G PU it utilizes

849
00:48:27,014 --> 00:48:29,099
the more that is available for Windows
Server see you can still improve the

850
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:30,156
performance of the system as a whole

851
00:48:31,056 --> 00:48:34,103
by just improving the performance a wrap
and instruments gives you the tools

852
00:48:35,003 --> 00:48:38,022
to monitor all that comp if you're just
doing the

853
00:48:38,022 --> 00:48:41,028
wider development on your app having
Activity Monitor open Internet be useful

854
00:48:41,082 --> 00:48:44,591
it's certainly not as in depth as
instruments but it will tell you how

855
00:48:45,329 --> 00:48:46,405
much CPU doing and more importantly

856
00:48:47,089 --> 00:48:50,210
it'll tell you how much energy your app
a is is taking

857
00:48:50,021 --> 00:48:52,097
to do what it's doing if you see that
offering a little higher than you're

858
00:48:52,097 --> 00:48:52,173
expecting

859
00:48:53,073 --> 00:48:56,148
that maybe another Q that your visual
effects and usage has

860
00:48:57,048 --> 00:49:01,437
gotten a little excessive finally for
the purest amongst you who really

861
00:49:01,869 --> 00:49:04,943
don't want to impact what they're after
doing by adding some do we stop the

862
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:06,390
profiler

863
00:49:06,039 --> 00:49:09,056
you can ssh in you sample for example
which will tell you what your app is

864
00:49:09,056 --> 00:49:10,079
doing

865
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:13,648
so we cover lots into quick summary
these things

866
00:49:14,359 --> 00:49:17,407
I mention the m.s and Ron Haskins
especially Capen sets

867
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:21,320
also mentioned the new behaviors best
color the importance of Venice

868
00:49:21,032 --> 00:49:21,117
appearance

869
00:49:22,017 --> 00:49:26,052
and some significant role at the eye we
cover new window features

870
00:49:26,052 --> 00:49:30,901
especially the full-size content view up
but also the title with Billy option C

871
00:49:31,369 --> 00:49:34,140
you can make your title bars look like
Safari and maps

872
00:49:34,014 --> 00:49:37,048
arm we also covered the transparent I'll
bar which is what notes and reminders

873
00:49:37,048 --> 00:49:39,187
are using to have that Christmas parents

874
00:49:39,619 --> 00:49:43,450
all the way from the bottom to the top
of their windows up

875
00:49:43,045 --> 00:49:46,080
Corbin gave you a huge run through on
its visual effect you and what you can

876
00:49:46,008 --> 00:49:47,032
do with our visual effects

877
00:49:48,004 --> 00:49:51,543
how appearances environments they are
accomplished and finally

878
00:49:51,579 --> 00:49:54,730
course remember like 40 seconds ago we
talk a little bit about performance

879
00:49:54,073 --> 00:49:57,212
and I do hope your your cake summers
performance Methodist heart

880
00:49:57,869 --> 00:50:01,060
a when you leave oh literally

881
00:50:01,006 --> 00:50:04,525
wanna have failed to mention though is a
be a new escrow you API

882
00:50:04,579 --> 00:50:07,800
they were using contract with full-size
content you didn't make it into the

883
00:50:07,008 --> 00:50:08,537
scene you got earlier this week

884
00:50:09,329 --> 00:50:12,700
but it will be available to you shortly

885
00:50:12,007 --> 00:50:15,052
up so I like to point out Jay parents
are

886
00:50:16,015 --> 00:50:19,016
primer to evangelist he is here in the

887
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:22,955
plaid shirt and be dark a vibrant
appearance shoes we have taken to

888
00:50:23,099 --> 00:50:25,950
describing his appearance in great
detail throughout the course of the week

889
00:50:25,095 --> 00:50:27,140
I'm here to see what we come up with
tomorrow

890
00:50:28,004 --> 00:50:31,007
um we also for some documentation
available online

891
00:50:31,043 --> 00:50:33,982
a developer Apple com is also where you
can get the courts to bug too I

892
00:50:34,369 --> 00:50:34,443
mentioned

893
00:50:35,109 --> 00:50:39,640
and of course Adele performs there some
relation related sessions

894
00:50:39,064 --> 00:50:42,088
adapting wrapped in New why I was the
session yesterday that

895
00:50:42,088 --> 00:50:46,287
available online now additionally later
this afternoon there's what's new in

896
00:50:47,079 --> 00:50:49,570
Interface Builder which will cover not
only a bit what we

897
00:50:49,057 --> 00:50:52,093
we show you doing their best for the day
but other use for fiscal yr tools for

898
