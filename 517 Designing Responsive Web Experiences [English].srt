1
00:00:12,004 --> 00:00:17,098
good morning everyone a

2
00:00:17,098 --> 00:00:21,127
p some hard for when people hear
specially on

3
00:00:22,027 --> 00:00:25,124
you know the morning after the beer bash
know you're all hardware

4
00:00:26,024 --> 00:00:29,039
I'm welcome to the designing responsive
web experiences

5
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,088
session my name is Casey and Ted

6
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:36,180
and today we're gonna show you how you
can build one website

7
00:00:36,018 --> 00:00:39,062
that's gonna look great everywhere I'm
by the way

8
00:00:39,062 --> 00:00:42,076
anytime if a website during that session
we mean

9
00:00:42,076 --> 00:00:46,055
any wet media I'm on the iBooks team and
on the web gettin

10
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:51,000
I we want both your digital books and
your website

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,051
to a great everywhere so we don't have
to tell you that

12
00:00:55,051 --> 00:00:59,127
your website is being viewed on a whole
variety different devices and screen cut

13
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:03,103
what we can do though is teach you some

14
00:01:04,003 --> 00:01:08,006
really easy techniques that you can use
to ensure that your website looks great

15
00:01:08,033 --> 00:01:08,096
on all

16
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:11,149
I would be very clear it up

17
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:15,057
what we are not going to talk about
today

18
00:01:15,057 --> 00:01:20,356
is building multiple versions region
these devices back today fashion

19
00:01:20,869 --> 00:01:23,944
it in the antithesis I'll the mobile
specific site

20
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:27,644
there will be no iNDOT domain name

21
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:31,900
here so instead arnold one website looks
great on out

22
00:01:32,179 --> 00:01:35,248
an effect that had the design

23
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:38,874
they can adapt and adjust always look
good on all

24
00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:42,436
all these different devices is usually
referred to

25
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:46,140
as a website that has a response and
design

26
00:01:46,014 --> 00:01:49,072
responding design

27
00:01:49,072 --> 00:01:53,361
it just just a buzzword it just means
that your website

28
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:57,660
its sensitive to its environment which
will allow it to adapt

29
00:01:57,066 --> 00:02:03,445
in change just simply always look good
and so did a 10 denier gonna show you

30
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:06,170
not only what a simple

31
00:02:06,017 --> 00:02:10,856
idea a responsive design is but really
how simple it is to implement

32
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:14,170
we're gonna look

33
00:02:14,017 --> 00:02:18,089
at response a cock columns are really
great way to both at them

34
00:02:18,089 --> 00:02:21,117
visual interest your website is well as

35
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:27,034
improve the legibility oversight will
also teach you about

36
00:02:27,034 --> 00:02:31,098
on trial 2 units and how you can use
them to make sure that your layout

37
00:02:31,098 --> 00:02:37,145
has been Belletti every font size and
intense going to show you how you can

38
00:02:38,045 --> 00:02:39,364
use the S shake

39
00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:43,775
to rap text around images I will make
sure that those

40
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:48,030
images are ready ready and for the

41
00:02:48,003 --> 00:02:52,028
up larger design changes that we need to
make will use media queries

42
00:02:52,028 --> 00:02:55,092
and finally the finishing touch will be
hairlines

43
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:58,154
we can really dive indeed and make you
so those beautiful red

44
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:03,223
so why are we talking about this anyway

45
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:07,732
no when he does a really great job
making sure

46
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:10,941
that your website looks just as great

47
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,790
on the iPhone as it does on the desktop
it just shrinks your site down

48
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:20,448
and makes a bit on the phone screen and
then the user can double tap or pinch to

49
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,370
zoom in to make sure

50
00:03:22,037 --> 00:03:27,516
that they can be that text the text
becomes larger that and it looks great

51
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:32,340
notta lotta work Fri and when he does
the same thing

52
00:03:32,034 --> 00:03:36,101
for more complex sites like this one
that had an i mean just shrinks all that

53
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:38,480
formatting and layout down

54
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:43,480
into one screen and it feels great right
can you read that text

55
00:03:43,048 --> 00:03:46,837
barely at all not really in any

56
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:50,278
mobile designers our website designers
have looked at this in fed

57
00:03:50,359 --> 00:03:55,290
I can't have that I'm gonna have to make
a mobile specific site

58
00:03:55,029 --> 00:03:59,948
you know we get you want your website to
look great

59
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:04,246
you want to be clear and easy to read
without users having two double tap

60
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:09,667
and pensions zoom and pan around and
something you may be thinking well

61
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:14,560
of course it doesn't look great you need
to add a medic you portray

62
00:04:14,056 --> 00:04:19,104
another great first step medically
imports gonna make your text larger

63
00:04:20,004 --> 00:04:24,059
relation to the screen size but the
thing is is that your layout

64
00:04:24,059 --> 00:04:28,059
still all Tinian shrunk down so now
you've got these big words

65
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:32,077
and shrunk down layout and it just that
what's up

66
00:04:32,077 --> 00:04:35,144
right so lest you think

67
00:04:36,044 --> 00:04:40,109
okay casey you know really we're gonna
have to make a mobile specific site now

68
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:46,055
please keep in mind that we're not
building web sites for just

69
00:04:46,055 --> 00:04:50,064
the iPhone the iPad the desktop

70
00:04:51,045 --> 00:04:54,073
and to prove it if your look at our
website

71
00:04:54,073 --> 00:04:57,107
on the desktop looks great right we
designed it

72
00:04:58,007 --> 00:05:01,045
we designed for this window size
basically but a I

73
00:05:01,045 --> 00:05:04,124
shrink down the window who

74
00:05:05,024 --> 00:05:10,025
I've got the thing problem here that I
do on the phone

75
00:05:10,034 --> 00:05:14,073
so we need to make sure that we're
building a site that looks great

76
00:05:14,073 --> 00:05:18,108
no matter what our windows so so far
I've laid out

77
00:05:19,008 --> 00:05:23,090
just a whole lotta knows I said I we
can't make mobile specific site

78
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:27,060
I'm using a medical report isn't going
to get you on the way there

79
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:31,060
and you have to build a website that
works for

80
00:05:31,006 --> 00:05:34,092
everything all possible permutation on
the desktop so

81
00:05:35,046 --> 00:05:39,095
what can we do well done

82
00:05:39,095 --> 00:05:42,169
our goal here is to use some simple as
hard as I and techniques

83
00:05:43,069 --> 00:05:46,072
and seems like the best way to
foreigners just to identify

84
00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:49,104
specific problems that we're seeing
right now

85
00:05:50,004 --> 00:05:54,026
and has worked to the one-time sounds
good I mean the first one is obvious to

86
00:05:54,026 --> 00:05:55,071
me is that

87
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:58,093
masthead atop become so tall

88
00:05:58,093 --> 00:06:01,111
on the phone and I have to scroll to see
the content

89
00:06:02,011 --> 00:06:05,096
and the other thing is is those columns
are just really skinny like

90
00:06:05,096 --> 00:06:09,137
so it's completely legible and that
caption on our galaxy is blowing right

91
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:10,132
out of the image in

92
00:06:11,032 --> 00:06:15,035
covering earns taxer yeah it's pretty
horrible where do you think we should

93
00:06:15,035 --> 00:06:16,092
start

94
00:06:16,092 --> 00:06:19,174
I think we're sorry the columns as the
protection of

95
00:06:20,074 --> 00:06:24,116
okay but certainly cock I personally
really like all

96
00:06:25,016 --> 00:06:29,021
I it love that they add both the visual
interest to my website

97
00:06:29,066 --> 00:06:32,125
and that they improve the legibility
it's really the perfect combination of

98
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:37,058
form and function

99
00:06:37,058 --> 00:06:40,137
and columns are great for this because
they're able to

100
00:06:41,037 --> 00:06:44,096
I divide up big blocks attack

101
00:06:44,096 --> 00:06:48,125
into more legible choc so what I we
might have had a big block a really long

102
00:06:49,025 --> 00:06:52,081
line for tax I'm now able to have very
consumable

103
00:06:52,081 --> 00:06:55,090
side ray now the problem we ran into

104
00:06:56,071 --> 00:06:59,092
with our website and why those homes
weren't looking good

105
00:06:59,092 --> 00:07:02,126
is because we define set number

106
00:07:03,026 --> 00:07:06,098
up call that had to be there for every
screen size

107
00:07:06,098 --> 00:07:09,116
right so when our window shot down those

108
00:07:10,016 --> 00:07:13,018
homes had to be calm really narrow

109
00:07:13,018 --> 00:07:17,019
and we were only able to have a few
words per line

110
00:07:17,028 --> 00:07:21,030
soda make your columns responsive

111
00:07:21,003 --> 00:07:24,038
all we have to do is instead a defining
a column count

112
00:07:24,065 --> 00:07:29,109
where set number of columns on our page
we just to find the conduit

113
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:34,097
so to give you an example of this I have
to web page is here

114
00:07:34,097 --> 00:07:39,194
a simplified a where one has the comms
defining column with

115
00:07:40,094 --> 00:07:44,166
one has the comp to find the compound by
car like to add to my site

116
00:07:45,066 --> 00:07:49,120
now when I resize that window

117
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:53,068
re says that window I the column

118
00:07:53,086 --> 00:07:56,091
though the page that we define the
column with that

119
00:07:56,091 --> 00:08:00,093
we have to call maintained that legible
with

120
00:08:01,011 --> 00:08:04,065
whereas the column count had a shrink
down like we saw before

121
00:08:04,065 --> 00:08:07,065
so responder homes really great

122
00:08:07,065 --> 00:08:10,131
defining the column with is really great
because WebKit will automatically

123
00:08:11,031 --> 00:08:14,102
add or eliminate columns as room becomes
available

124
00:08:15,002 --> 00:08:19,041
hours removed and we recommend when you
are defining

125
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:22,085
%uh your column with that you use a

126
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:26,101
bond relative unit final two minutes
really great because

127
00:08:27,001 --> 00:08:32,037
if your user resizes their tax the
columns with what of the resize

128
00:08:32,037 --> 00:08:37,051
to match that to give you a simplified
example

129
00:08:37,051 --> 00:08:40,390
here we have the alphabet right there's
5

130
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:43,866
letters on that first line in the first
column

131
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:49,310
ABCD any now because my columns with is
to find

132
00:08:49,031 --> 00:08:54,540
and a pot relative unit when I make my
text smaller

133
00:08:54,819 --> 00:08:58,790
I will maintain those five letters
across the top and the same thing goes

134
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:01,788
with the number words on your call will
maintain a legible bring

135
00:09:02,499 --> 00:09:05,514
word so all this

136
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:08,712
great functionality in these responses
Kong's it seems like you're getting a

137
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,287
lot here right

138
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:14,172
it's just one CSS property you just to
calm with

139
00:09:15,009 --> 00:09:19,230
to find home with and define it with the
bottle to unit in this case for using

140
00:09:19,023 --> 00:09:22,132
15 min so to show you

141
00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:26,860
how great columns are in real time
here's had the demo

142
00:09:26,086 --> 00:09:29,125
okay thanks KC here we are so here's
this

143
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:35,180
website the case in adults and looking
pretty great at this

144
00:09:35,018 --> 00:09:40,037
that's really fast at this window with

145
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:45,056
but as you saw when we make it 1 an hour

146
00:09:45,056 --> 00:09:48,118
the column seconding harder harder to
read

147
00:09:49,018 --> 00:09:53,055
and to the point we had hearings just
very logical so if they can sit in the

148
00:09:53,055 --> 00:09:55,074
corner I have a little bit a javascript
showing me

149
00:09:55,074 --> 00:10:00,913
what the window with this so I can make
adjustments as necessary

150
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:04,603
sup has cases suggested let's try

151
00:10:04,819 --> 00:10:08,740
setting at home with incentive our
compound so and this code you can see I

152
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:09,403
have

153
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:17,069
the compound 3 skill that's

154
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:23,813
i sat with said in a calm with 215
around like a suggested

155
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:27,276
save that hillard

156
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:30,912
and nothing's changed are when they're
with the still wide enough to

157
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:34,160
accommodate three columns like we had
before

158
00:10:34,016 --> 00:10:37,315
at this time as we get more now

159
00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:40,490
will have a point but see her happens
right okay here

160
00:10:40,049 --> 00:10:43,098
around 1100 pixels without that two
columns

161
00:10:43,098 --> 00:10:47,927
still really logical and again as we get
even smaller

162
00:10:48,809 --> 00:10:51,824
we're at a point around seven hundred
and

163
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:54,976
somewhat pixels where we go doubt one
call which

164
00:10:55,129 --> 00:10:59,162
even at Nara sweater with still a very
logical

165
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:03,470
amount of tax I mean we're not on that
side bar stool is terrible

166
00:11:03,047 --> 00:11:07,124
but that's really all I have to do to
get

167
00:11:08,024 --> 00:11:12,055
support on Scarlett just single property

168
00:11:12,055 --> 00:11:16,824
was done a little bit more into

169
00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:20,418
the features a the Caesars columns

170
00:11:21,309 --> 00:11:24,990
call model okay

171
00:11:24,099 --> 00:11:28,104
so you seen the column counts and call
with properties

172
00:11:29,004 --> 00:11:32,010
which are pretty straightforward when
you are

173
00:11:32,001 --> 00:11:37,007
laying out a page with columns it's best
to has a white space between the columns

174
00:11:37,016 --> 00:11:41,055
if you don't the lines can run together
be really hard to read

175
00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:46,160
and this is controlled with the conga
property

176
00:11:46,016 --> 00:11:49,073
are you might wanna decorative line
inside the cap you can

177
00:11:49,073 --> 00:11:53,242
to find such lot with the car real
property whose syntax is just like the

178
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:56,943
border properties are you seeing already

179
00:11:57,339 --> 00:12:00,347
and finally if you'd like an element to
pop out your columns

180
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:06,050
span across the aisle I you can easily
do this with the can span property

181
00:12:06,005 --> 00:12:09,060
which looks really great

182
00:12:09,006 --> 00:12:12,965
so to sum up making response columns and
adjust

183
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:18,567
two different fireman is super easy I'm
sees as get you a lot of that free

184
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,663
by isn't home with property

185
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:24,891
I want to expand a bit though on why

186
00:12:24,999 --> 00:12:29,083
we chose to use Farrell to the unit
there

187
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,470
farrell to the units are exactly what
the sound like they're

188
00:12:33,047 --> 00:12:36,105
CSS units that are defined in terms of
your car font-size:

189
00:12:37,005 --> 00:12:41,068
or some other text metric that's related
font-size:

190
00:12:41,068 --> 00:12:45,092
and it's very common to use is a Sep the
filesize itself

191
00:12:45,092 --> 00:12:48,186
but you can also use them for any party
a layout whose size should be

192
00:12:49,086 --> 00:12:51,172
proportional to the current excise

193
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:56,481
an obvious example would be the margins
are under paragraphs

194
00:12:57,129 --> 00:13:01,155
as fun size increases you like those
margins also increase

195
00:13:01,389 --> 00:13:04,540
in proportion to that

196
00:13:04,054 --> 00:13:07,098
and the big benefit hears that by using
his

197
00:13:07,098 --> 00:13:11,193
units your layout will automatically
adjust to different font sizes

198
00:13:12,093 --> 00:13:16,099
now you set up a lot size are you so
much change it they could use command

199
00:13:16,099 --> 00:13:16,161
passing

200
00:13:17,061 --> 00:13:21,160
minus or perhaps they've changed the
minimum

201
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:26,470
fun size setting which is very common
for low-vision users

202
00:13:26,047 --> 00:13:32,066
see should always make your layout just
to font size are you not expecting

203
00:13:32,066 --> 00:13:36,345
there are four relative units and see is
a phat relative units and CSS

204
00:13:36,939 --> 00:13:40,410
I'll there's the AM which I'm sure
you're all very familiar with its very

205
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:41,049
popular

206
00:13:41,049 --> 00:13:46,088
very common on the web and and M is
defined in terms of the font size

207
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:52,740
other car talent which may be inherited
from its ancestors

208
00:13:52,074 --> 00:13:56,363
less common as the axe which is
approximately half an hour

209
00:13:57,029 --> 00:14:00,052
it's really supposed to be basically the
height %uh

210
00:14:00,259 --> 00:14:03,290
a lower his letter on

211
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:06,558
this is very useful when you're trying
to size an element

212
00:14:06,819 --> 00:14:12,360
inside a lot of Texel looks natural next
to the rest the text-align:

213
00:14:12,036 --> 00:14:15,255
the CH is based on the

214
00:14:15,579 --> 00:14:19,850
with I love the numeral 0 which may seem
random

215
00:14:19,085 --> 00:14:22,090
a that is a typical character with

216
00:14:23,035 --> 00:14:26,061
and so you can use it for sizing an
input element

217
00:14:26,061 --> 00:14:30,040
where you're expecting save 30
characters you could say 30 ch

218
00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:33,597
and will be a approximately the right
size and finally

219
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:37,470
we come to the RAM which is the unit the
cases using

220
00:14:37,047 --> 00:14:40,906
a the RAM is just like the AM that
you're already familiar with

221
00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:45,330
but instead of being based on the font
size a the current element

222
00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:50,800
its always based on the font size up the
body at the root element

223
00:14:50,008 --> 00:14:53,069
so I would you want to use Rams
incentive Adams you are using ann's

224
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:58,150
their great for you here's a simple
example

225
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:01,574
that a simple website with a header

226
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:05,125
hello on the left a size with aum's

227
00:15:05,629 --> 00:15:09,350
on the right side with brooms

228
00:15:09,035 --> 00:15:14,704
okay so far this is a they're they're
identical everything works the same

229
00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:18,107
well few months from now I me to change
my website

230
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:23,350
added a container element happens to
have the center inside it

231
00:15:23,035 --> 00:15:26,074
and because someone told me is how I
roll to the Nats

232
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:29,456
I went ahead and size that hot size for
them as well

233
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:34,136
so what i expect to happen is this I
want ok nothing to change

234
00:15:34,829 --> 00:15:38,891
a but if I'd use Em's for my header

235
00:15:39,449 --> 00:15:43,542
what happens the browsers as well this
font sizes and M's

236
00:15:44,379 --> 00:15:48,350
okay well what's up air France is all
that stands and keep looking up until

237
00:15:48,035 --> 00:15:49,774
find the country font-size:

238
00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:54,112
and then computes the sort of compound
font-size:

239
00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:57,910
and so the result is something way
bigger than I intended when I for size

240
00:15:57,091 --> 00:15:57,142
Hatter

241
00:15:58,042 --> 00:16:01,491
few months ago unlike that

242
00:16:01,869 --> 00:16:05,860
in the case a friend's its always
looking back to the body element its

243
00:16:05,086 --> 00:16:06,105
gaping asshole

244
00:16:07,005 --> 00:16:10,534
and has a chance so I've never have a
different font size

245
00:16:10,579 --> 00:16:13,653
than expected okay

246
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:17,393
so take a quick look at fun relative
units and

247
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:21,102
why I think the Rams pretty great

248
00:16:21,489 --> 00:16:27,492
let's take a look at our website and see
where we are

249
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,525
offense looking pretty good and it's
definitely better

250
00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:33,628
on we definitely stop the sidebar there

251
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:37,126
that a significant issue but I think
tackle that

252
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:41,651
later hi what you want to do next I also
what kind loving me is all that weight

253
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:41,823
tax

254
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,405
around the unknown right all that extra
white space I just I feel like we're not

255
00:16:45,999 --> 00:16:47,037
making a good use

256
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:50,381
this been released a and just feel kinda
clunky

257
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:53,615
yeah I mean the whole point love
adjusting our call with in the first

258
00:16:53,939 --> 00:16:55,942
place was to have a nice readable

259
00:16:56,239 --> 00:17:00,243
alliance and our moon is really a
interfering with that wind is really

260
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:00,340
narrow

261
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:04,650
by the tech sector definitely so let's
take a look at that

262
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:07,151
so to simplify here's our moon we
floated it

263
00:17:08,051 --> 00:17:11,088
in our column in those lines next to it
the fly-around

264
00:17:11,088 --> 00:17:14,417
the image element and they look really
now

265
00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:18,270
and well

266
00:17:18,027 --> 00:17:21,062
and a whole lotta time to fix this so
the easiest thing

267
00:17:21,062 --> 00:17:25,097
is you know we had to stop huddling and
that way there's no Nara lines extabit

268
00:17:25,097 --> 00:17:28,175
looks pretty good rent okay at 10

269
00:17:29,075 --> 00:17:32,137
you could do that on I have a feeling
though that you have a much

270
00:17:33,037 --> 00:17:36,586
clever easy solution to that and

271
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:40,320
is just kinda feels like a cop-out it
okay

272
00:17:40,032 --> 00:17:43,061
fair enough a so

273
00:17:43,061 --> 00:17:46,070
with a new feature called sees the
shapes

274
00:17:46,007 --> 00:17:49,012
is available in your sanity and I would
say

275
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:53,451
we can actually flow that text around
the courage to the minute look really

276
00:17:53,649 --> 00:17:54,820
great

277
00:17:54,082 --> 00:17:57,146
I'm so what's going on here CSS shapes

278
00:17:58,046 --> 00:18:02,755
it's a simple feature that allows you to
flow text around

279
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:07,169
afloat element with uninteresting shaper
geometry

280
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:10,181
so in this case triangle

281
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:13,364
or circle like a moon or cases favorite

282
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:17,760
miss pacman come

283
00:18:17,076 --> 00:18:20,133
soccer is this four-man so

284
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:25,061
like we saw before we have our militant
it's just an element of course

285
00:18:25,061 --> 00:18:28,159
and we floated it within our call

286
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:32,258
now it just so happens that this image
to the moon is on a transparent

287
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:35,100
background

288
00:18:35,001 --> 00:18:39,087
and sees the shapes has a great feature
where you can provide it with an image

289
00:18:39,096 --> 00:18:42,145
and I will use here the visible are
opaque part that image

290
00:18:43,045 --> 00:18:46,754
to the final shape into this with one
property

291
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:51,184
property is called shape outside and
this case for providing at the image of

292
00:18:51,409 --> 00:18:51,472
the Moon

293
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:56,051
it'll look into the image data and say
okay here's the opec part

294
00:18:56,159 --> 00:19:01,460
as you can see our by the text now
flying around the answer them

295
00:19:01,046 --> 00:19:08,046
it's that easy critique or a course it's
not easy

296
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:11,600
of course it's not easy because I lucked
out my moon is on transparent background

297
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:13,340
already

298
00:19:13,034 --> 00:19:16,973
but a lot of times it's not you have an
image that's entirely up a

299
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:21,500
and it don't on how to photoshop skills
to go and in

300
00:19:21,005 --> 00:19:24,029
fix-up I certainly that actually love
you do share

301
00:19:24,074 --> 00:19:28,145
a so I do now so as you can see I still
have a chip on side property

302
00:19:29,045 --> 00:19:32,101
but this is a pic min so

303
00:19:33,001 --> 00:19:37,300
shape doesn't have anything to go on
here

304
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:40,383
fortunately we can also in in addition
to using an image

305
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:44,940
as a source for the shape their we can
simply use some basic

306
00:19:44,094 --> 00:19:47,151
geometric shapes as well and of course
the moon a

307
00:19:48,051 --> 00:19:51,139
luckily for me %uh is a circle

308
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:55,058
so what I want to do is

309
00:19:55,409 --> 00:19:59,700
somehow tell the season shapes model to
use this

310
00:19:59,007 --> 00:20:02,099
circled for the text around and I do
that using the

311
00:20:03,062 --> 00:20:06,107
circle function pretty straight forward
it takes

312
00:20:07,007 --> 00:20:11,038
one argument the radius in this case I
use fifty percent because I wanted the

313
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:12,067
diameter the moon

314
00:20:12,409 --> 00:20:15,970
at that the diameter the circle to be
the full with the initial

315
00:20:15,097 --> 00:20:18,159
nice looking pretty good

316
00:20:19,059 --> 00:20:22,075
there are other predefined shapes to
take one example

317
00:20:22,075 --> 00:20:25,124
a you can use an ellipse

318
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:29,026
a course in lips with the same
dimensions

319
00:20:29,026 --> 00:20:32,695
iXYS just circles I really haven't
changed anything

320
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:36,070
but you can get really interesting with
this too a

321
00:20:36,007 --> 00:20:41,085
if there's a polygon function allows you
to define fairly arbitrary shape

322
00:20:41,085 --> 00:20:45,086
so as an example I drew an octagon
around my man

323
00:20:45,095 --> 00:20:48,099
partner function takes a sequence of x,y
coordinates

324
00:20:48,099 --> 00:20:52,258
and it was pretty great actually

325
00:20:53,149 --> 00:20:58,237
and all this was still again with just
one seize the property

326
00:20:59,029 --> 00:21:02,500
okay cool we see how easy it is

327
00:21:02,005 --> 00:21:05,081
to use CSS shapes to get a really great
visual effect those

328
00:21:06,026 --> 00:21:10,044
basically a possible 24

329
00:21:10,044 --> 00:21:14,101
we will do next well let's take a look
back at our Web site

330
00:21:15,001 --> 00:21:18,003
so now we have the text going around the
moon really well which I

331
00:21:18,021 --> 00:21:22,062
think looks much better I'm

332
00:21:22,062 --> 00:21:26,136
the one thing that I i'm saying no is
those images look a little

333
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:30,485
by the on on the phone you think

334
00:21:30,809 --> 00:21:33,960
I agree I mean look at that galaxy

335
00:21:33,096 --> 00:21:37,111
yeah I I definitely think that we need
to make our site

336
00:21:38,011 --> 00:21:43,180
ready at all pixelated yeah that's not
as having too many beers the burbs

337
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:46,860
so let's provide a high-resolution image
for this

338
00:21:46,086 --> 00:21:50,160
I'm you know in the past a previous
study thieves we've talked about

339
00:21:51,006 --> 00:21:54,575
how to rectify I think that's a word
right

340
00:21:55,169 --> 00:21:58,170
retin-a by check it's working now you
can write it down

341
00:21:58,179 --> 00:22:01,267
we're going to talk about how to rectify
your website so that you have

342
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:06,690
some brilliant clearer images on all
your website

343
00:22:06,069 --> 00:22:09,163
and in the past we talked about and
talked about how to use kinda

344
00:22:10,063 --> 00:22:14,111
alternatives images so long you know one
example that was like

345
00:22:15,011 --> 00:22:19,022
instead abusing a image for gradient

346
00:22:19,022 --> 00:22:22,024
you should use a CSS gradient right

347
00:22:22,024 --> 00:22:25,713
the one thing we haven't talked about
though is how

348
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:28,976
like what I do which is just make boats
like

349
00:22:29,399 --> 00:22:32,400
i've a web site with all my photography

350
00:22:32,409 --> 00:22:35,471
when I do with that we having be an
attack on the image of me

351
00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:39,610
yet what the heck right so own new

352
00:22:39,061 --> 00:22:42,146
to OS 10 and I i say

353
00:22:43,046 --> 00:22:47,144
we have image subset image source:
that's what you really

354
00:22:48,044 --> 00:22:51,048
easily add both a standard

355
00:22:51,084 --> 00:22:54,893
resolution image and the retina
resolution image and the WebKit

356
00:22:55,649 --> 00:22:58,725
well just magically pick the right one
depending on what

357
00:22:59,409 --> 00:23:03,496
type a screen your website being viewed

358
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:07,288
and it looks kinda like this so

359
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:11,730
here's my galaxy image on a standard
screen

360
00:23:11,073 --> 00:23:14,902
it looks pretty good by here it is

361
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:18,582
on a Retina screen it's pretty pixelated

362
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:23,830
so fortunately it's very very easy to
fix

363
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:27,162
and all you have to do is to start with
the image on it

364
00:23:28,062 --> 00:23:32,501
so here's a middleman she look pretty
familiar to most view

365
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:36,690
it hasn't really changed since the 90's
ray up but

366
00:23:36,069 --> 00:23:39,098
because I'm always look for an
opportunity to tell up tax

367
00:23:39,098 --> 00:23:43,167
I'm gonna go to walk you through it us
our first act review and they're is our

368
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:44,074
all

369
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:49,130
at review please always included because
anyone who's using a screen reader

370
00:23:49,013 --> 00:23:53,672
need to understand what is going on in
this big beautiful image you provide in

371
00:23:53,789 --> 00:23:56,830
and then second I have my source
attribute

372
00:23:56,083 --> 00:24:00,272
which is just the location up the image

373
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:06,230
so to make this standard image element
into an image source at

374
00:24:06,023 --> 00:24:10,034
all you have to do is add the source at
Acuvue

375
00:24:10,034 --> 00:24:13,035
so inside my source actually view is

376
00:24:13,044 --> 00:24:16,753
literally a second images I have

377
00:24:17,149 --> 00:24:21,165
my standard Galaxy .jp hang am a super
galaxy

378
00:24:21,309 --> 00:24:25,630
.jp for meyer et screens and the
difference between those is this

379
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:25,136
modifier

380
00:24:26,036 --> 00:24:29,815
1x per standard in two acts for rent
rights and then

381
00:24:30,139 --> 00:24:33,200
web pic think can automatically
understand which

382
00:24:33,002 --> 00:24:36,091
images for which screen

383
00:24:36,289 --> 00:24:39,330
now some love you who are actually
reading through my syntax

384
00:24:39,033 --> 00:24:42,222
might have noticed some redundancy in
there

385
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:45,870
you're saying doubted if a twice yeah so

386
00:24:45,087 --> 00:24:49,116
galaxy that a pic my standard resolution
images in their two-time

387
00:24:49,899 --> 00:24:52,924
and you might think well let's just

388
00:24:53,149 --> 00:25:00,090
that's the source rate but browsers that
do not understand source at

389
00:25:00,009 --> 00:25:04,088
are not gonna know what to do it so for
backwards compatibility let's keep the

390
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:04,740
source

391
00:25:04,074 --> 00:25:08,162
and instead we will back out every move
that 1x

392
00:25:09,062 --> 00:25:12,136
resolution image from the source at so

393
00:25:13,036 --> 00:25:16,735
back wake very little amount mark-up
rate

394
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:21,059
with just a small amount a mark-up we've
made our website

395
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:24,750
are image on it retin-a ready in
research that's a really

396
00:25:24,075 --> 00:25:28,138
great they load only the right image so
you're going to avoid that double

397
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:30,187
download

398
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:33,730
there's no additional CSS you don't have
to go

399
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:36,109
in there in muck around with your
dimensions or anything like that

400
00:25:37,009 --> 00:25:41,095
and is backwards compatible which is
this little amount as intact this one

401
00:25:41,095 --> 00:25:43,654
after him

402
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:47,730
so so far I've talked to you about image
source: set

403
00:25:47,073 --> 00:25:50,148
in your HTML it just so happens that
their

404
00:25:51,048 --> 00:25:56,577
is another feature that we talked about
at BBC in the past that has

405
00:25:57,009 --> 00:26:00,074
incredibly similar name and an
incredibly similar function

406
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:03,695
so we're gonna go over that real quick
to so that you can understand when you

407
00:26:04,019 --> 00:26:04,570
use

408
00:26:04,057 --> 00:26:07,095
which and why so images

409
00:26:07,095 --> 00:26:10,944
source at which we discover during your
HTML

410
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:16,460
but image that living RCS that and their
intended

411
00:26:16,046 --> 00:26:21,095
for styling your website like orders are
background

412
00:26:21,095 --> 00:26:26,064
so image that for say I do have one of
those background images that I want

413
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:31,924
to make retin-a ready I'll just start
with my background image

414
00:26:32,419 --> 00:26:36,610
you see I have my URL my galaxy .jp had

415
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:39,108
and to make it into an image that I had
a

416
00:26:40,008 --> 00:26:43,073
second background-image: property and
with in it

417
00:26:43,073 --> 00:26:46,111
is the image Sat function

418
00:26:47,011 --> 00:26:50,046
and not functioning contains both the my
edges

419
00:26:50,046 --> 00:26:54,095
it contains the Galaxy J Pak my favorite
1x

420
00:26:54,095 --> 00:26:57,182
am a super galaxy Jay pag with to act

421
00:26:58,082 --> 00:27:02,100
and then when kept from here what
automatically select the right one

422
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,659
I'd like to point out that you do need
to have both love your background image

423
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:07,710
properties there

424
00:27:07,071 --> 00:27:10,110
for backwards compatibility so

425
00:27:11,001 --> 00:27:15,004
image that image source: that they're
great

426
00:27:15,013 --> 00:27:18,075
there easy they make it super easy for
adding both standard

427
00:27:18,075 --> 00:27:21,614
and Brett images when people pick the
right one

428
00:27:22,289 --> 00:27:25,380
just remember that your H your HTML

429
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:29,060
image source at are for your content
those big beautiful photographs we

430
00:27:29,006 --> 00:27:30,045
talked about

431
00:27:30,639 --> 00:27:34,210
and your CFS image that's are for your
style

432
00:27:34,021 --> 00:27:38,220
so your background images your borders

433
00:27:38,409 --> 00:27:43,740
so I think both are going to be a really
great solution for your website

434
00:27:43,074 --> 00:27:48,003
juicy iraq yes

435
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:52,674
well it's way better really happy about
that I was worried that

436
00:27:53,169 --> 00:27:58,181
they've had too much fun to the rest
last night okay so where are we now

437
00:27:58,289 --> 00:28:01,960
we've got I read the image and

438
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:04,935
we still have a bunch of basic math
problems on this page

439
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:08,820
that we haven't dressed yet yeah I read
it image

440
00:28:08,082 --> 00:28:12,271
looks good I S except that you can't
really fear right at the giant caption

441
00:28:13,009 --> 00:28:14,017
over its ridiculous

442
00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:19,700
suspects up some her remaining their
problems by using CSS me decrease

443
00:28:19,007 --> 00:28:23,062
I'm sure love you uses all time a
solicits jump right in

444
00:28:24,025 --> 00:28:31,025
and take care these remaining issues

445
00:28:31,069 --> 00:28:34,168
here we are again much love from there
can see the

446
00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:38,827
text loading their round on me now so
pretty good

447
00:28:39,169 --> 00:28:42,620
big fan okay what's a and

448
00:28:42,062 --> 00:28:46,071
as you know as we

449
00:28:46,629 --> 00:28:49,850
maker his narrower the lead gets more
more crazy

450
00:28:49,085 --> 00:28:52,162
in particular I don't like how the

451
00:28:53,062 --> 00:28:57,157
mass had a by page here's taking up so
much vertical space

452
00:28:58,057 --> 00:29:02,786
this caption as really offer the overlap
my image

453
00:29:03,299 --> 00:29:07,190
in fact it's blown way out of it and
overlapping the heading below it

454
00:29:07,019 --> 00:29:10,868
and then the sidebar is really really
narrow

455
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,080
artery let's fix it to these

456
00:29:14,008 --> 00:29:18,057
also with the header

457
00:29:18,129 --> 00:29:21,147
so as you can see at the corner like a
mess and I have that any better

458
00:29:21,309 --> 00:29:23,330
JavaScript to show how what I would do
it

459
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:26,597
so where a does the header start go

460
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:31,460
go off it seems like between

461
00:29:31,046 --> 00:29:36,099
650 and 700 pixels somewhere in there we
hit multiple lines

462
00:29:36,099 --> 00:29:39,238
as is our earlier on the phone we have
like four lines of

463
00:29:40,129 --> 00:29:45,230
text so I'm I want to adjust the size of
a header somewhere around

464
00:29:45,023 --> 00:29:48,202
but 290 pixels or something

465
00:29:48,409 --> 00:29:52,070
let's let's do that do this in many
years

466
00:29:52,007 --> 00:29:56,586
the at media rule

467
00:29:56,649 --> 00:30:00,820
so here I have in at media rule

468
00:30:00,082 --> 00:30:03,173
this is the part css3 provide immediate
very in this case

469
00:30:04,073 --> 00:30:07,149
max with the 675 pixels and then

470
00:30:08,049 --> 00:30:11,318
inside braces you press the provide
whole style sheet of things you'd like

471
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:13,950
to change at that point

472
00:30:13,095 --> 00:30:19,099
in this case I'm finding that masthead
header and adjusting its fun size down

473
00:30:19,099 --> 00:30:23,108
okay so we made that change to refresh

474
00:30:24,008 --> 00:30:30,087
nothing changed because this is wider
than that brake plant 675 pixels

475
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,120
so let's make their site were narrow and
there we go

476
00:30:34,012 --> 00:30:40,681
I had a smaller and those great even
here at this very nice

477
00:30:40,789 --> 00:30:44,865
walking next I think I'll take care love
this caption

478
00:30:45,549 --> 00:30:49,573
so just like with the header I need to
figure out where it starts looking

479
00:30:49,789 --> 00:30:53,790
bad it's looks great out here two lines

480
00:30:53,889 --> 00:30:56,978
I'm still pretty happy with it here and
it seems to be right around where it

481
00:30:57,779 --> 00:30:58,110
goes

482
00:30:58,011 --> 00:31:01,032
four lines where that bottom right
corner

483
00:31:01,032 --> 00:31:05,123
isn't ruling in spike out saying really
kinda ruining the mood

484
00:31:06,023 --> 00:31:09,322
okay so where was that that seems to be
here between

485
00:31:09,529 --> 00:31:13,544
seven hundred and 750 pixels

486
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,700
okay sold just like with a header

487
00:31:16,889 --> 00:31:19,903
I use it at media rule this time

488
00:31:20,029 --> 00:31:23,980
with the match with that said 150 pixels
and what we're doing here is

489
00:31:23,098 --> 00:31:26,120
are initially my caption a

490
00:31:27,002 --> 00:31:31,064
is absolutely positioned so that it can
be a overlay on top of my image

491
00:31:31,082 --> 00:31:34,181
and its witness at 30 percent so that it

492
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:38,580
takes about half the size limits like
Sep

493
00:31:38,058 --> 00:31:41,094
so in my military here I want to
override

494
00:31:41,094 --> 00:31:44,403
both the position and with properties so
that

495
00:31:45,249 --> 00:31:48,265
it will simply appear below the image

496
00:31:48,409 --> 00:31:51,474
%uh and take up the full with the call
not that

497
00:31:52,059 --> 00:31:56,320
so we'll save and Kyle

498
00:31:56,032 --> 00:31:59,211
and fresh

499
00:31:59,499 --> 00:32:02,480
and as you can see the site before
nothing's changed because I'm still

500
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:02,122
wider than

501
00:32:03,022 --> 00:32:09,023
that may decrease test but as we get
closer to the bad part

502
00:32:09,023 --> 00:32:12,692
there's a pop down it's quite legible or
image

503
00:32:12,899 --> 00:32:16,440
and doesn't interfere with that no
matter how narrow in this screen gets

504
00:32:16,044 --> 00:32:21,873
okay cool let's take care that site by
that I think the last bit but looks

505
00:32:22,269 --> 00:32:29,269
pretty bad in our size so where does
that get unreadable

506
00:32:29,084 --> 00:32:32,086
in this case I I feel like right around
here's where

507
00:32:32,086 --> 00:32:35,123
the blockquote inside my sidebars
getting

508
00:32:36,023 --> 00:32:40,062
to be you know one or two pair words per
line it's religion our

509
00:32:40,269 --> 00:32:45,306
so let's make an adjustment around a
hundred a 50 pixels

510
00:32:45,639 --> 00:32:49,666
but now I think you know the drill this
adjustment is exactly like the other

511
00:32:49,909 --> 00:32:51,971
ones we have an admiral

512
00:32:52,529 --> 00:32:57,460
for with 800 pixels apparently the
sidebar is floated over

513
00:32:57,046 --> 00:33:01,865
so I'm disabling the flow just like with
my caption I'm

514
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:05,293
resetting the with so will automatically
be a

515
00:33:05,419 --> 00:33:09,470
the with its container and killing some
in the margins we have their

516
00:33:09,047 --> 00:33:14,366
so that the sidebar the %ah set from the
calls text

517
00:33:14,789 --> 00:33:17,820
so if we come back and refresh

518
00:33:17,082 --> 00:33:20,151
still there but as I get smaller there
we go

519
00:33:20,889 --> 00:33:25,952
the sidebars popped and now in line with
the rest of your document

520
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:29,543
and even the really really narrow screen
size

521
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:32,834
start to look pretty good

522
00:33:33,509 --> 00:33:36,596
okay

523
00:33:37,379 --> 00:33:43,360
let's talk a little bit more about me
series

524
00:33:43,036 --> 00:33:46,465
as he saw a reuse many crews and CSS

525
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:50,873
by using at media role which takes a

526
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:56,100
Munich Re test and then some CSS to
apply

527
00:33:56,001 --> 00:34:00,025
when that military matches so here I am

528
00:34:00,034 --> 00:34:04,703
fixing a caption like this are earlier
by using a Mac with military

529
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:08,600
and then I'm overriding the position
with properties

530
00:34:08,006 --> 00:34:11,105
this is in general how you use it at
meteorol you have some rules somewhere

531
00:34:12,059 --> 00:34:13,127
else in your style sheet

532
00:34:14,027 --> 00:34:19,124
and then you say okay but and sometimes
I need to override this

533
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:23,071
in all three cases we use the match with
media period because we were just saying

534
00:34:23,071 --> 00:34:25,270
for when things got an hour

535
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:28,927
there are several other media here is
that you know of money is

536
00:34:29,089 --> 00:34:32,440
when doing responsive design there is a
corresponding

537
00:34:32,044 --> 00:34:36,213
men with military a where you can adjust
things as the

538
00:34:36,609 --> 00:34:39,690
seichas wider and also up

539
00:34:39,069 --> 00:34:43,072
an exact with mediocre

540
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:48,231
when you're adjusting your site to be
retin-a reading

541
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,977
in addition to using the features that
cases showed you earlier you might need

542
00:34:52,859 --> 00:34:54,270
to make some let it just means

543
00:34:54,027 --> 00:34:57,101
and you can test for I read the device
by using

544
00:34:58,001 --> 00:35:01,610
the device pixel ratio military which
just like with

545
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:07,980
takes min and max variance

546
00:35:07,098 --> 00:35:10,217
when adjusting your lawn with a Munich
Re

547
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:14,100
there's a few things just keep in mind

548
00:35:14,109 --> 00:35:17,900
first of the admiral is actually a very
blunt

549
00:35:17,009 --> 00:35:20,074
instruments what you're doing is

550
00:35:21,055 --> 00:35:26,119
making an entire altar in style sheet
that applies in certain circumstances

551
00:35:27,019 --> 00:35:31,638
you have to duplicate the selectors are
using in here to fall style sheet to

552
00:35:31,809 --> 00:35:33,760
over I particular properties

553
00:35:33,076 --> 00:35:37,092
and as your site grows this can lead to
a really

554
00:35:37,092 --> 00:35:41,011
a large maintenance burden you might
double or triple or quadruple the size

555
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:42,740
of your

556
00:35:42,074 --> 00:35:45,089
style sheet

557
00:35:45,089 --> 00:35:48,098
so instead

558
00:35:48,098 --> 00:35:53,119
when possible should try to use CSS
features that naturally adapt your side

559
00:35:54,019 --> 00:35:57,103
without having to duplicate all your
work we sought to earlier

560
00:35:58,003 --> 00:36:02,049
a the calm with property allowed us to
adjust the number of columns magically

561
00:36:02,049 --> 00:36:02,868
basically

562
00:36:03,309 --> 00:36:07,460
without resorting to military and the
image that function

563
00:36:07,046 --> 00:36:10,945
allows us to pick the right image for
our display without having to use the

564
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:13,250
device disarray share property

565
00:36:13,025 --> 00:36:17,027
military it secondly

566
00:36:17,027 --> 00:36:20,070
when I was adjusting early out there

567
00:36:20,007 --> 00:36:23,886
I was doing experiments Lee a lot on my
side

568
00:36:24,579 --> 00:36:28,460
fiddle with by screen have window with
and found where

569
00:36:28,046 --> 00:36:31,093
each part of my lap when pat and then
made adjustments

570
00:36:31,093 --> 00:36:34,722
for that I didn't look up the

571
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:39,180
dimensions a particular screen on
Wikipedia

572
00:36:39,018 --> 00:36:43,114
I let my concert actually tell me where
it needed to be adjusted

573
00:36:44,014 --> 00:36:47,014
this'll make your cut content more
resilient to

574
00:36:47,014 --> 00:36:53,102
and ever increasing granger scenarios
where it might be worth it

575
00:36:54,002 --> 00:36:58,081
okay so we've made her final and
adjustments with

576
00:36:58,099 --> 00:37:02,780
so many queries and there's just one
little bit I wanted to address

577
00:37:02,078 --> 00:37:05,097
before we can holiday

578
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:08,496
and this is

579
00:37:09,369 --> 00:37:13,140
some of these borders on our site so you
can see up top there we have this little

580
00:37:13,014 --> 00:37:14,493
byline of

581
00:37:14,619 --> 00:37:17,950
the Friday edition of the Daily space
digest

582
00:37:17,095 --> 00:37:21,189
and bottom borders around it and they
look great on live laptop

583
00:37:22,089 --> 00:37:25,092
on but their little thick

584
00:37:25,092 --> 00:37:28,147
on my phone I i mean one pic support

585
00:37:29,047 --> 00:37:32,068
and I wanted it to be a one pixel border
a

586
00:37:32,068 --> 00:37:36,076
but of course as yard now

587
00:37:36,076 --> 00:37:41,151
when I say one picks on CSS I don't
actually get one pixel on let's play

588
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:46,064
the CSS pixel is defined to be a sort of

589
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:50,077
abstract measurement that roughly
corresponds

590
00:37:50,077 --> 00:37:54,095
to one physical pixel on a pre read its
way

591
00:37:54,095 --> 00:37:58,141
but now with reading device once is a
special actually contains for

592
00:37:59,041 --> 00:38:02,720
by special

593
00:38:03,089 --> 00:38:07,160
so I want to do is to reach into this is
a special and you speak

594
00:38:07,016 --> 00:38:11,030
full use each other's device pixels I
wanna try

595
00:38:11,003 --> 00:38:14,028
hairline borders

596
00:38:14,055 --> 00:38:17,114
okay some right now

597
00:38:18,014 --> 00:38:22,022
I'm dry my border a with one picks on
CSS

598
00:38:22,094 --> 00:38:25,096
and when that draws on a standard
display

599
00:38:25,096 --> 00:38:29,485
I get with an islamic past look at and
on a Retina display

600
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:33,740
I get this a line is twice as thick

601
00:38:33,074 --> 00:38:38,150
as actually what so what I want to do is
really only use one

602
00:38:39,005 --> 00:38:42,098
row or column are of device pixel to get
this line

603
00:38:43,043 --> 00:38:46,072
so how to do it that's

604
00:38:46,072 --> 00:38:52,146
look at our CSS here I'm sending my
border with one pixel

605
00:38:53,046 --> 00:38:57,053
I'm not the only one who is what airline
borders love you have to

606
00:38:57,053 --> 00:39:00,118
and I gotta say some other solutions
people have come up with are

607
00:39:01,018 --> 00:39:06,051
amazing and horrified

608
00:39:06,051 --> 00:39:08,060
here's my favorite says pretty brilliant

609
00:39:09,041 --> 00:39:14,117
it uses a a inline SVG image annotator
URL as a background image

610
00:39:15,017 --> 00:39:18,060
everyone got that it's really easy to
remember how to type this as I'm sure

611
00:39:18,006 --> 00:39:18,102
you can see

612
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:23,092
art let's cut this out

613
00:39:23,092 --> 00:39:26,160
this is ridiculous and now

614
00:39:27,006 --> 00:39:30,094
I'm really pleased to say that in
yosemite and I'll essay

615
00:39:31,048 --> 00:39:35,055
WebKit has an able to feature that we
call sub-pixel layup

616
00:39:36,018 --> 00:39:39,090
now mostly this won't affect we doing at
all

617
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:41,083
it's a magical under the hood
improvement that just makes things a

618
00:39:42,064 --> 00:39:42,140
little bit better

619
00:39:43,004 --> 00:39:46,066
we can take advantage of it to get the
headlines we want

620
00:39:47,002 --> 00:39:50,080
without having to do this sort of thing
okay

621
00:39:50,008 --> 00:39:54,056
how we do it so here we have our 1 pixel
for center display

622
00:39:55,028 --> 00:39:58,090
and out just like we saw before with our
media queries

623
00:39:58,009 --> 00:40:01,070
write a check to buy space for issued a
CRO arianna redness pain

624
00:40:02,051 --> 00:40:05,095
we r great and all we're doing is saying
we're on our readiness

625
00:40:05,095 --> 00:40:08,096
display great just use a half pixel

626
00:40:08,096 --> 00:40:11,139
remember the CSS pixel is

627
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:15,043
to device pixels innings to mention so I
have a pixel

628
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:18,085
corresponds to that beautiful thing and
device pixel

629
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:23,041
and now I can actually read this and
remember what I meant when I for it

630
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:26,109
that's exciting and here we are

631
00:40:27,009 --> 00:40:32,041
got my right now iPad and if we use the
magic if he notices a min on that

632
00:40:32,041 --> 00:40:35,056
you can see those lines are still as I
possibly get

633
00:40:35,056 --> 00:40:42,056
who I ThinkPad re:

634
00:40:43,089 --> 00:40:47,114
so our website now looks home much
better

635
00:40:48,014 --> 00:40:51,107
minus are that engineering design field
and it looks great

636
00:40:52,007 --> 00:40:56,008
on every device and when very little
mark-up I come

637
00:40:56,008 --> 00:40:59,054
coming on the coded video I think we
actually own a chance about 20 lines

638
00:40:59,054 --> 00:41:02,118
pretty good ray I'm yes

639
00:41:03,018 --> 00:41:08,023
thank you all we had to do.

640
00:41:08,023 --> 00:41:14,032
was maker columns response that we
define the with the bar column instead

641
00:41:14,032 --> 00:41:15,035
of a compound

642
00:41:15,035 --> 00:41:20,099
we also designed our layout so that it
wasn't bomb relative units which means

643
00:41:20,099 --> 00:41:20,146
that

644
00:41:21,046 --> 00:41:25,055
our users change their font size we are
going to have

645
00:41:25,055 --> 00:41:28,147
fidelity to our layout also 10 show you
how do you see a

646
00:41:29,047 --> 00:41:32,100
shapes so that now we have the text
flowing

647
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,071
beautifully around the curvature for
moon and

648
00:41:36,071 --> 00:41:39,114
both our galaxy Inter Milan image are
retin-a ready

649
00:41:40,014 --> 00:41:45,042
then we also covered how to use media
queries are blunt instrument

650
00:41:45,042 --> 00:41:49,047
for did making larger layout changes
when necessary

651
00:41:49,047 --> 00:41:52,125
and icing on the cake for those

652
00:41:53,025 --> 00:41:57,027
