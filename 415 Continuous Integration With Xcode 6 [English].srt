1
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,835
good afternoon everyone welcome to you
our session continuous integration with

2
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,930
Xcode six thanks for being here this
afternoon

3
00:00:17,093 --> 00:00:20,832
my name is branching come a softer
engineer army Xcode team

4
00:00:21,669 --> 00:00:25,430
today we'll talk about my favorite topic
which is of course continuous

5
00:00:25,043 --> 00:00:25,732
integration

6
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:31,240
so just a show of hands how many people
are using some kind of continuous

7
00:00:31,024 --> 00:00:32,068
integration system out there

8
00:00:32,068 --> 00:00:35,101
alright our son okay expression

9
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:40,010
how many people are using Xcode server
okay okay

10
00:00:40,019 --> 00:00:43,710
good well well we hope next year when we
ask that question

11
00:00:43,071 --> 00:00:46,144
that's going to be everyone so if you're
not familiar with continuous integration

12
00:00:47,044 --> 00:00:50,233
we're gonna teach you all about it today
we're going to talk to you about

13
00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:54,140
are continuous integration product which
we call Xcode server

14
00:00:54,014 --> 00:00:57,253
we're gonna tell you about all the great
new things we built into

15
00:00:57,379 --> 00:01:00,820
Xcode server if I wanna see that slide
are

16
00:01:00,082 --> 00:01:03,144
at three months a great new features in
Xcode server in Xcode 6

17
00:01:04,044 --> 00:01:07,044
going to be a lot of demos because it
really shows well

18
00:01:07,044 --> 00:01:11,049
on the screen so first if you're not
familiar with

19
00:01:11,094 --> 00:01:14,133
continues electorate integration what is
that all about

20
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:18,932
more fundamentally it's all about
improving software quality

21
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:24,231
and there a lotta ways it does that a
continuous integration system a cat has

22
00:01:24,429 --> 00:01:25,437
problems quickly

23
00:01:25,509 --> 00:01:28,570
and automatically so you don't have to
worry that when you make a change at the

24
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:29,970
end of the day

25
00:01:29,097 --> 00:01:33,122
and you'll even introduced a bill there
a warning not to worry about that not

26
00:01:34,022 --> 00:01:34,091
being caught

27
00:01:34,091 --> 00:01:37,108
until the next morning because the
system like this is gonna cut it for you

28
00:01:38,008 --> 00:01:41,167
quickly and automatically and for me
that really enhances collaboration

29
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,970
because you don't have to worry

30
00:01:42,097 --> 00:01:45,226
about a blocking your team members

31
00:01:46,099 --> 00:01:49,162
and let's face it when you're writing
code you taking lotta risks

32
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:53,020
you doing interesting creative things
you can introduce problems

33
00:01:53,002 --> 00:01:57,006
and a system like this helps you I got
helps catch those problems quickly

34
00:01:57,006 --> 00:02:01,235
another key thing is a system like this
helps problem

35
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:04,940
run on your test coverage because you
have your code running on a server

36
00:02:04,094 --> 00:02:07,583
the server can support lots of different
testing configurations would be a big

37
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:09,520
pain to do on a client

38
00:02:09,052 --> 00:02:12,148
so not a great thing about

39
00:02:13,048 --> 00:02:17,056
a server product that's building your
code the can gather history so

40
00:02:17,056 --> 00:02:20,405
build history in Test history for your
product overtime

41
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:23,953
this is actually really interesting
because at the beginning of

42
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:28,280
are product development cycle as I'm
sure you know there's a lot of change

43
00:02:28,028 --> 00:02:30,114
there's a lot to turn and there's
probably you're probably introducing a

44
00:02:31,014 --> 00:02:31,095
lot issues

45
00:02:31,095 --> 00:02:34,162
here to sing warnings and static
analysis issues and you probably don't

46
00:02:35,062 --> 00:02:36,073
have a lot of tests

47
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:39,150
at the beginning and it towards the and
love that cycle

48
00:02:40,005 --> 00:02:44,084
you don't have any issues anyone a lot
of tests and a system like this

49
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:47,604
will help gather that history and show
it to charities such a great indication

50
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:48,829
where you are

51
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:52,590
kinda been your product development
cycle and of course a system like this

52
00:02:52,059 --> 00:02:55,488
makes it really easy preview distribute
builds to your team

53
00:02:56,019 --> 00:02:59,400
so hopefully have testers I hope
everyone does

54
00:02:59,004 --> 00:03:02,433
and if you do a system like this makes
it easy to distribute those kinda built

55
00:03:02,829 --> 00:03:06,010
so terminology

56
00:03:06,001 --> 00:03:09,950
bear with me here so there are three
terms that we're going to talk about

57
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:12,973
over and over again in relation to
exclude server

58
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:17,900
term number one is a scheme so I'm ok
with anyone but I'm sure if you've used

59
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:18,608
Xcode for a while

60
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:23,950
you've seen this term and it's really
simple all the scheme is

61
00:03:23,095 --> 00:03:26,244
just a recipe for building your product
it contains

62
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:30,120
the targets that you want build on the
target intern

63
00:03:30,012 --> 00:03:33,023
contains the source files in the
resources and everything else that make

64
00:03:33,023 --> 00:03:33,762
up your product

65
00:03:33,969 --> 00:03:37,036
so why this important for export server
it's important

66
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:40,705
because the scheme is to be shared this
is not a big deal

67
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:45,365
excavated really easy to share schemes
but when you first create a scheme

68
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,700
were next to a greater scheme for you
that scheme was injured water how to do

69
00:03:49,007 --> 00:03:49,102
it it's not a big deal

70
00:03:50,065 --> 00:03:53,384
to something to keep in mind so turned
over to you

71
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:57,050
bought answer from the Bach and I

72
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:01,787
it's just the thing that we the word we
use to refer to the thing that builds

73
00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:04,886
your software on schedule and

74
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:08,790
when the bot runs we say that it
integrates that makes an integration

75
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:11,728
so these are the three key terms scheme
bought and integration

76
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:16,970
so let's take a look and a little more
depth

77
00:04:16,097 --> 00:04:19,736
at are from the bot so

78
00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:26,650
what defines a bot so

79
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:26,128
up

80
00:04:27,028 --> 00:04:30,075
fundamentally there to keep this
information one is the property want to

81
00:04:30,075 --> 00:04:30,117
block

82
00:04:31,017 --> 00:04:35,516
to build that's pretty basic the second
is the SCM information or the source

83
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:37,840
control information so where does your
product live

84
00:04:37,084 --> 00:04:41,168
so if your product lives and get
repository or a Subversion repository

85
00:04:42,068 --> 00:04:45,095
and Xcode can check out your project
been incredible

86
00:04:45,095 --> 00:04:49,154
for your project that's really simple on
next part about about

87
00:04:50,054 --> 00:04:54,076
a bot is the schedule so when do you
want the bot integrate the lot possible

88
00:04:54,076 --> 00:04:54,985
options here

89
00:04:55,669 --> 00:04:59,950
you can choose discover your bod
periodically so every hour one today

90
00:04:59,095 --> 00:05:02,156
your you once a week if you want are
there's also on commits bar

91
00:05:03,056 --> 00:05:07,108
on commit parts and it's a very popular
option because it means whenever anyone

92
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:09,020
commit source control

93
00:05:09,002 --> 00:05:12,008
to repository about a fire of
integration

94
00:05:12,026 --> 00:05:15,029
and of course there's also a manual
scuttling to

95
00:05:15,056 --> 00:05:18,915
cell how to build

96
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:23,210
I'm so the solution scheme comes into
place the shirts came to the bar

97
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:26,103
how to build the project and you can
also configure three other option so

98
00:05:27,003 --> 00:05:30,050
you want about to run static analysis
join protests

99
00:05:30,005 --> 00:05:33,058
and you want to go archives and finally

100
00:05:34,003 --> 00:05:37,049
about won't be a whole lotta good I
wouldn't tell you when something went

101
00:05:37,049 --> 00:05:37,054
wrong

102
00:05:37,099 --> 00:05:40,160
so we have a great system for
notifications and you can set these up

103
00:05:41,006 --> 00:05:42,635
the fire before about integrates

104
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:46,780
and after about immigrants so that your
you and your team know the results in

105
00:05:46,078 --> 00:05:46,155
the generation

106
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:50,064
it's like I said

107
00:05:50,064 --> 00:05:54,109
been we call our continuous integration
product Xcode server

108
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:58,036
and their to you parts mexico server
actually there's the

109
00:05:58,036 --> 00:06:01,134
Xcode Park apart within the expert
application and there's a part that

110
00:06:02,034 --> 00:06:03,125
lives in the Austin server application

111
00:06:04,025 --> 00:06:08,030
this is important to know if you try to
set this up with just Xcode you not

112
00:06:08,003 --> 00:06:09,008
gonna get very far

113
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:12,038
we also need to get Austin server you to
get partisan

114
00:06:12,065 --> 00:06:15,089
a new preview not be a warning about the
website this week

115
00:06:15,089 --> 00:06:18,134
and when it gets released are to the
public it's also available on the App

116
00:06:19,034 --> 00:06:19,038
Store

117
00:06:19,074 --> 00:06:22,138
so there are two parts to it instruments
features

118
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:26,097
that integrates very easily with the
Apple Developer Program and this is

119
00:06:26,097 --> 00:06:26,176
really important

120
00:06:27,076 --> 00:06:30,150
because in order to run any of your code
on devices we need to do all the

121
00:06:31,005 --> 00:06:32,070
provisioning and certificate stuff

122
00:06:33,015 --> 00:06:37,020
arm and that is to know your Apple
Developer information in order to do all

123
00:06:37,002 --> 00:06:37,033
that

124
00:06:37,051 --> 00:06:40,083
apart the product we make it really easy
to get started without

125
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:43,151
in a course occurred to rebuild any I
was a Mac products

126
00:06:44,051 --> 00:06:48,119
the Facebook and all that ex-con served
and when the really great features

127
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:52,102
about exco server is that it can run
your tests on multiple devices in

128
00:06:53,002 --> 00:06:53,068
simulators

129
00:06:53,068 --> 00:06:56,073
so think about it before we have this
product if you want to test

130
00:06:57,018 --> 00:07:00,107
on a couple iPhones in a couple iPad's a
couple iPod Touches

131
00:07:01,007 --> 00:07:04,043
you have to plug each one of these and
here your development system

132
00:07:04,043 --> 00:07:08,047
separately and run the tests on them it
was a big pay but I can plug all those

133
00:07:08,047 --> 00:07:09,111
devices and to an expert server

134
00:07:10,011 --> 00:07:13,038
you can configure bought to run tests on
all those devices

135
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:16,043
and it's great you have is that really
brought has covered are talking about

136
00:07:16,088 --> 00:07:16,617
before

137
00:07:17,409 --> 00:07:21,414
the course expert server can produce IPA
in pkg files

138
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:25,440
seeking to more easily distribute these
products and his great

139
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:30,090
integration in Xcode it looks pretty
good too like I said I was 10

140
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:34,077
server is the other com part of this
equation said it was really easy has got

141
00:07:35,058 --> 00:07:36,149
great features like Coast repositories

142
00:07:37,049 --> 00:07:41,053
and this is where you you configure the
device is that you wanna make available

143
00:07:41,089 --> 00:07:46,156
for testing your software will show you
them about in just a minute so last year

144
00:07:47,056 --> 00:07:49,108
extra five major tax cuts over for the
first time

145
00:07:50,008 --> 00:07:53,019
we're really really proud of its up its
features at

146
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:57,022
when we took a look at the product and
we took a look at what features you

147
00:07:57,049 --> 00:07:57,147
wanted to build

148
00:07:58,047 --> 00:08:02,246
in this release and future releases is
pretty clear to us that there were parts

149
00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:04,870
are the foundation that we really need
to improve

150
00:08:04,087 --> 00:08:07,163
so we're happy to say we have a shiny
new foundation for Xcode server in Xcode

151
00:08:08,063 --> 00:08:08,119
6

152
00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:12,076
it's much better in all ways it's faster
more reliable

153
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:16,163
super scaleable and its largest at our
sport for all these great features like

154
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:21,152
support for swift support for
performance testing a new feature we

155
00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:22,860
call issue tracking

156
00:08:22,086 --> 00:08:26,089
and probably the most requested feature
from the first version

157
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:29,100
was triggers thank you

158
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,052
thank you just wait just right up like I
said we have a great new foundation

159
00:08:35,052 --> 00:08:38,080
Superliga super reliable and it's really
skillful to

160
00:08:38,008 --> 00:08:41,627
so I decided to do a little test a few
weeks ago attacking all Mac Pro

161
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:45,860
I was sitting in my office a 25 year old
Mac Pro it wasn't doing anything which

162
00:08:45,086 --> 00:08:45,123
is

163
00:08:46,023 --> 00:08:49,052
was a nice for rest for me on a set up
ex-con server

164
00:08:49,052 --> 00:08:52,116
on Xcode 6 on and I decided to add a few
boats

165
00:08:53,016 --> 00:08:56,020
so I started with a small app it started
with the but the DC up

166
00:08:56,056 --> 00:09:00,094
you have today new devices a credible
for that that went pretty well

167
00:09:00,094 --> 00:09:03,100
I decided to just keep going so

168
00:09:04,054 --> 00:09:07,107
at a bar for Xcode that went really well

169
00:09:08,007 --> 00:09:11,896
at a bot for games under that went
pretty well again these are parts are

170
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:13,930
running on this one alzheimer

171
00:09:13,093 --> 00:09:17,098
Hyderabad for the maps project for you I
K miles all going well so I threw up

172
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,124
getting there too

173
00:09:19,024 --> 00:09:22,873
this is a very old piece of hardware its
billing box for all these products both

174
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:26,400
small be given a really big and is doing
just great

175
00:09:26,004 --> 00:09:28,088
so this is something that just wasn't
possible with the first version Mexican

176
00:09:29,024 --> 00:09:30,032
server

177
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:35,413
triggers okay so we heard you you ask
for this loud and clear

178
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:39,150
and we're really a really great story
for traders so we support triggers

179
00:09:39,015 --> 00:09:43,017
both before an immigration starts and
after an innovation runs

180
00:09:43,017 --> 00:09:46,041
and there are lots of interesting
reasons for supporting both of these

181
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:49,063
on their number of conditions you can
specify

182
00:09:49,063 --> 00:09:52,115
determine when a trigger runs and their
two talk two triggers

183
00:09:53,015 --> 00:09:57,044
there's a shell script writer and at
Notre so it's really cool

184
00:09:57,044 --> 00:10:00,101
about shell script triggers that you can
do anything you want to do

185
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:04,056
right should the shell script and we
provide a number environment variables

186
00:10:04,056 --> 00:10:05,139
that you can leverage in the shell
scripts

187
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:09,043
and we'll see a few of those in the demo
in just a little bit

188
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:12,136
are that your reports that we provide
you can configure them to you

189
00:10:13,036 --> 00:10:15,765
show you just the minimum amount
information which is just like the

190
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:17,113
builders and warnings

191
00:10:17,329 --> 00:10:20,530
are or you can customize those and make
them really rich

192
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:23,352
and out all the issue tracking that we
do

193
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:27,160
speaking issue tracking what is this
what an issue an issue with either a

194
00:10:27,016 --> 00:10:28,019
built-in warning

195
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:31,040
build their static analysis issue

196
00:10:31,004 --> 00:10:34,090
or a test failure and issues are
important

197
00:10:35,026 --> 00:10:39,038
you don't wanna ship software with
issues the fact we have a policy

198
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:42,102
really good policy on the X codeine
waters there's a build

199
00:10:43,002 --> 00:10:46,066
morning or static analysis issue are in
the store space

200
00:10:46,066 --> 00:10:49,143
that's a p1 and that's what we work on
it's important we can ship with these

201
00:10:50,043 --> 00:10:50,104
things

202
00:10:51,004 --> 00:10:55,015
and you should check with them either
and by having a great issue tracking

203
00:10:55,015 --> 00:10:58,954
service in Xcode server makes it really
easy to know when those issues

204
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:03,230
get introduced and we can do really cool
things like a contract that issue all

205
00:11:03,023 --> 00:11:04,382
throughout its life cycle

206
00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:07,780
so the issue still exists we mark that
as an on resolve issue

207
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:11,156
and then when an issue finally gets
resolved we service that in reports to

208
00:11:12,056 --> 00:11:15,102
and because it's got server tracks all
this history over time it's really great

209
00:11:16,002 --> 00:11:18,010
easy to see when an issue was introduced

210
00:11:18,001 --> 00:11:23,016
are and even who introduced were we can
be pretty smart about that

211
00:11:23,025 --> 00:11:27,067
so has a lot of stuff there um butter
really

212
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:30,236
bring the point home I think it's better
to show and mrs. like to bring up Matt

213
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:31,730
number one

214
00:11:31,073 --> 00:11:38,073
is gonna talk about these things

215
00:11:40,028 --> 00:11:41,117
alright thank you so much brent

216
00:11:42,017 --> 00:11:45,055
and as you heard we got a real a lot a
really great new features in

217
00:11:45,055 --> 00:11:48,060
experts-- German experts 6 are but in
case you've never used before we're

218
00:11:49,005 --> 00:11:50,039
gonna start from the very beginning

219
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:53,132
which begins in server cell we have West
End server

220
00:11:54,032 --> 00:11:57,067
installed on this machine which you can
get from developer that Apple that com

221
00:11:57,067 --> 00:12:00,118
you need the preview to work with Xcode
6 beta that you all got this week

222
00:12:01,018 --> 00:12:04,066
I we've already set it up on this
machine you can see our servers called

223
00:12:04,066 --> 00:12:04,137
pop art

224
00:12:05,037 --> 00:12:08,080
I and it's ready to start integrating so
what we're gonna do is set up

225
00:12:08,008 --> 00:12:11,009
Xcode server so we select Xcode

226
00:12:11,081 --> 00:12:14,163
on the left hand side in the services
West and the first thing that we ask you

227
00:12:15,063 --> 00:12:15,106
to do

228
00:12:16,006 --> 00:12:19,054
is choose which version of Xcode you're
going to be using so you do need

229
00:12:19,054 --> 00:12:22,136
Xcode installed on your server machine
in order for X whatever to work because

230
00:12:23,036 --> 00:12:24,091
that's what actually does all the
building

231
00:12:24,091 --> 00:12:27,095
arm but we give you choices which ex
could you use

232
00:12:27,095 --> 00:12:30,110
in case you want to try out a new
version of Xcode or in case you need to

233
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:34,022
support multiple versions RBIs SDK or
something like that

234
00:12:34,031 --> 00:12:37,114
so we're gonna select the Xcode that you
all have a copy of right now

235
00:12:38,014 --> 00:12:42,032
and when I choose that its gonna start
setting up our database

236
00:12:42,032 --> 00:12:45,103
it's going to generate Klein SSL
Certificates and its gonna start all

237
00:12:46,003 --> 00:12:46,012
over processes

238
00:12:46,093 --> 00:12:49,189
so that we're ready to start doing
integrations with tax cuts are and after

239
00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:50,096
a few seconds

240
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:55,116
that set up and it's ready to go now if
you're doing Mac development only

241
00:12:56,016 --> 00:12:59,024
that's all you need to do you can stop
right there all set

242
00:12:59,024 --> 00:13:03,058
good to go are because gonna be testing
on devices and everything that we do and

243
00:13:03,058 --> 00:13:04,063
I always need to be code signed

244
00:13:05,008 --> 00:13:08,096
we also need a way for Xcode server to
be able to do that Kodak

245
00:13:08,096 --> 00:13:12,134
and for that we're going to join Apple
Developer Connection team to do that

246
00:13:13,034 --> 00:13:16,106
we next to the developer teams label
there's an Add button

247
00:13:17,006 --> 00:13:24,006
so will choose that and then you sign in
with your Apple ID

248
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:32,040
and once you've signed in that's going
to give you the option to become a

249
00:13:32,004 --> 00:13:32,063
member

250
00:13:32,099 --> 00:13:36,105
all your developer team so when I click
add what is actually going to do

251
00:13:37,005 --> 00:13:41,014
is add your server as a new person on
your Apple developer team gets its own

252
00:13:41,014 --> 00:13:42,033
set of certificates

253
00:13:42,033 --> 00:13:46,098
private keys signing identities and it's
also going to download a copy of all be

254
00:13:46,098 --> 00:13:49,161
provisioning profiles that work with the
app's that you have registered

255
00:13:50,061 --> 00:13:54,069
4ap ID's on your developer team and it
can take a few seconds because it does

256
00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:56,104
go out make Ubuntu Certificate Signing
requests

257
00:13:57,004 --> 00:14:01,006
and then pour does all in once it
finishes you'll see that you are now a

258
00:14:01,024 --> 00:14:01,066
member

259
00:14:01,066 --> 00:14:04,685
all the developer team that you signed
up for now

260
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,940
said going to test the devices I do have
an iPad Mini right here

261
00:14:08,094 --> 00:14:11,097
you can all see 30 I am when I'm gonna
do

262
00:14:11,097 --> 00:14:14,160
is plug it in right into my server
machine

263
00:14:15,006 --> 00:14:18,069
and after just a second in the devices
West

264
00:14:19,023 --> 00:14:22,061
back shows up so you can see it's ready
to use and it shows which teams it

265
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:22,145
enabled for

266
00:14:23,045 --> 00:14:27,048
if this devices never been used before
you also get an option right here to

267
00:14:27,048 --> 00:14:31,066
choose use for development and that goes
out to the port on attitude albertine

268
00:14:31,066 --> 00:14:34,078
so really easy to do from the screen

269
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:37,082
you also have the option of configuring
who can use your server so

270
00:14:38,018 --> 00:14:42,023
by default orkut this at a button here
you can see that but can be created by

271
00:14:42,023 --> 00:14:43,132
anyone who can login

272
00:14:43,339 --> 00:14:46,640
I and anyone can view those box once
they've been created

273
00:14:46,064 --> 00:14:49,127
we want to lock it down just a little
bit more so I'm gonna choose

274
00:14:50,027 --> 00:14:53,095
only some users can create parts
administrators is fine for me

275
00:14:53,095 --> 00:14:56,132
but I'll turn view only access for
everyone back up cell

276
00:14:57,032 --> 00:15:00,121
that's pretty good for me i think thats
a good good centre-backs controls for my

277
00:15:01,021 --> 00:15:01,066
server

278
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:04,077
from OS 10 server you can also set up

279
00:15:04,077 --> 00:15:08,106
hosted repositories if you like IX
conservative host your pocket or spore

280
00:15:09,006 --> 00:15:10,021
you can do that here

281
00:15:10,021 --> 00:15:14,082
you can also set that up directly from
within Xcode but that's all we need

282
00:15:14,082 --> 00:15:18,123
from server for right now so I'll close
server and will head back over into

283
00:15:19,023 --> 00:15:23,048
Xcode itself so when she wants tax code
the first thing you're gonna need to do

284
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:25,066
is set up an account for your server

285
00:15:25,066 --> 00:15:28,157
and that happens in the Preferences
window on the accounts to

286
00:15:29,057 --> 00:15:32,112
you can click the plus button in the
bottom left hand side

287
00:15:33,012 --> 00:15:37,016
and choose ad server and you can see my
server bobber is gonna show up right

288
00:15:37,016 --> 00:15:38,064
here saw select proper

289
00:15:38,064 --> 00:15:41,082
choose next and log in with my username

290
00:15:41,082 --> 00:15:45,090
and super secret password and there you
offset

291
00:15:46,062 --> 00:15:49,076
our wedding new features that we've had
in Xcode six which we think is pretty

292
00:15:49,076 --> 00:15:51,100
useful ways down at the bottom of the
Accounts window

293
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,053
we do show you which version OS 10 OS 10
server

294
00:15:55,053 --> 00:15:58,126
and Xcode your server machine is using
so if you've got multiple servers and

295
00:15:59,026 --> 00:16:00,102
something starts going a little funky

296
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:04,821
you can look right here and it'll tell
you what your server machine is running

297
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:08,870
that's not a bad place to start when
you're trying to diagnose the problem so

298
00:16:08,087 --> 00:16:08,180
that's all set

299
00:16:09,008 --> 00:16:12,026
we're gonna close the account went up
ever gonna open

300
00:16:12,098 --> 00:16:15,098
our project and it's a project called
coffee board

301
00:16:15,098 --> 00:16:18,327
so our team from time to time

302
00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:23,100
we make mistakes we're only human II
don't make that many mistakes but some

303
00:16:23,001 --> 00:16:24,001
people on our team do

304
00:16:24,001 --> 00:16:27,079
I and when that happens it's a mistake
happens that causes someone

305
00:16:27,088 --> 00:16:30,113
to spend more than happy day fixing a
problem we think

306
00:16:31,013 --> 00:16:34,972
retribution is in order so we britain
nap that keeps track of when that

307
00:16:35,089 --> 00:16:35,720
happens

308
00:16:35,072 --> 00:16:38,561
and assigns debts of coffee and ice
cream

309
00:16:39,209 --> 00:16:42,271
to the members of our team and we call a
copy boy so that's the separate here

310
00:16:42,829 --> 00:16:46,180
idea to Matt's gonna show it to you a
little bit later ob you can see it's got

311
00:16:46,018 --> 00:16:49,095
a lot of tests all setup guide is
written in swift which is pretty cool

312
00:16:49,095 --> 00:16:53,153
so incredible for that project a switch
over to the report navigator

313
00:16:54,053 --> 00:16:57,862
and I'll choose from the product menu
great pop

314
00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:02,670
now the first choice you get is which
scheme your project is going to

315
00:17:02,067 --> 00:17:05,075
integrate with I'll use the IRS one you
get to choose

316
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:09,112
what the name of your project within a
mere bachche is going to be such as

317
00:17:10,012 --> 00:17:10,831
coffee board

318
00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:14,480
are you also choose which server your
pockets created on and whether or not

319
00:17:14,048 --> 00:17:17,056
integrates immediately after creation so
I'll leave that set

320
00:17:17,056 --> 00:17:21,059
now one of the issues that some people
ran into in the first generation X good

321
00:17:21,086 --> 00:17:21,091
server

322
00:17:22,036 --> 00:17:24,131
was that you go through the process of
creating a body would all look like it

323
00:17:25,031 --> 00:17:25,810
was all fine

324
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:29,500
and then your but would go to run its
first integration and it wouldn't be

325
00:17:29,005 --> 00:17:30,028
able to check out your project

326
00:17:30,073 --> 00:17:33,131
which wasn't fun is that wasn't all that
easy to fix so when the new features

327
00:17:34,031 --> 00:17:35,088
without an Xcode 6

328
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:38,090
is the concept love source control
pre-flight

329
00:17:38,009 --> 00:17:41,084
so what's gonna happen when I click Next
is it's going to scan your entire

330
00:17:42,065 --> 00:17:43,089
workspace

331
00:17:43,089 --> 00:17:46,185
find all the source control working
copies that it knows about

332
00:17:47,085 --> 00:17:49,904
gather up the credentials the tax code
knows about that goes with those

333
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:51,670
repositories

334
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,400
package them up in a nice secure with a
bundle and send them up to the server

335
00:17:55,004 --> 00:17:58,015
so that the server can determine right
now if there's going to be a problem

336
00:17:58,051 --> 00:18:00,460
when it's time to check out the
repository

337
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:05,040
so I'll click Next tactical future

338
00:18:05,004 --> 00:18:09,016
so I click Next it tells us that all the
repositories that it found

339
00:18:09,016 --> 00:18:12,064
the coffee board repository it could not
indicate and that's because I was

340
00:18:12,064 --> 00:18:15,108
recently a victim of identity theft so I
change my password

341
00:18:16,008 --> 00:18:19,063
so what I can do now is correct this
issue right away so click the Change

342
00:18:19,063 --> 00:18:20,072
button

343
00:18:20,072 --> 00:18:23,154
enter my user name and my new password

344
00:18:24,054 --> 00:18:27,098
click Next and this time it says my
credentials are verified

345
00:18:27,098 --> 00:18:30,127
so it knows that when it goes to check
out my but for the first time it's going

346
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:33,112
to work which is a really comforting
feeling

347
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:38,065
cell now we have an option to choose how
frequently we want are brought to run

348
00:18:38,065 --> 00:18:41,120
which is great by default it's going to
be a periodic bar

349
00:18:42,002 --> 00:18:45,078
that runs hourly on the hour but because
we want this to be a little bit more

350
00:18:45,096 --> 00:18:45,162
alive

351
00:18:46,062 --> 00:18:49,079
for our demo we're gonna choose on
commit so that every time we make a

352
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:49,166
change the bot

353
00:18:50,066 --> 00:18:53,825
it's going to kick off a new immigration
you askin choose which

354
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:58,340
actions about will run when integrates
and also how frequently it cleans

355
00:18:58,034 --> 00:19:01,095
by the fall we always do incremental
bills but because I really like squeaky

356
00:19:01,095 --> 00:19:01,103
clean box

357
00:19:02,075 --> 00:19:06,163
I'm gonna choose always now depending on
which scheme you select

358
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:10,150
if your scheme can build targets that
have products that run on

359
00:19:11,005 --> 00:19:14,093
I O S or on Mac you have a choice out
where your targets

360
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:18,065
will run for testing cell since we're
doing

361
00:19:18,065 --> 00:19:21,107
and i OS target we are going to you use
I West

362
00:19:22,007 --> 00:19:25,079
but we do have an option to specifically
which devices are tests will run on

363
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:28,132
so I'll drill down into that and shoes
the iPad that a correct collect

364
00:19:29,032 --> 00:19:29,131
connected

365
00:19:30,031 --> 00:19:35,036
earlier on and then you get the option
to configure triggers and I'm gonna talk

366
00:19:35,036 --> 00:19:38,040
more about that in just a minute but we
will show you that by the fall

367
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:41,148
we create a trigger that will send an
email notification when something goes

368
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:42,133
wrong

369
00:19:43,033 --> 00:19:46,129
and you can choose if you'd like that
email to be sent to all your computers

370
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:50,112
and you can also build another West up
email addresses if you'd like to send it

371
00:19:51,012 --> 00:19:52,076
to more people

372
00:19:52,076 --> 00:19:55,138
you can choose what goes into that email
message where do you want issue an

373
00:19:56,038 --> 00:19:57,115
analysis issue summaries

374
00:19:58,015 --> 00:20:00,113
the commit message is if you wanna hide
those because they might that contain

375
00:20:01,013 --> 00:20:02,025
sensitive information

376
00:20:02,025 --> 00:20:05,030
or you can turn both off if you just
want people to know that integration is

377
00:20:05,075 --> 00:20:05,172
completed

378
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:09,161
are you asking choose when they see this
when that you know will get sent whether

379
00:20:10,061 --> 00:20:10,070
it's on success

380
00:20:11,051 --> 00:20:14,059
test failures bill there is or any
combination of the three

381
00:20:15,031 --> 00:20:18,083
so we could create are but will get
created

382
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:21,145
and after a few seconds it'll start
integrating

383
00:20:22,045 --> 00:20:25,097
and you can see another great new
feature we have an expert 6 is alive

384
00:20:25,097 --> 00:20:26,120
progress information

385
00:20:27,002 --> 00:20:30,034
right down to the cops source file
that's being compiled by a pop

386
00:20:30,052 --> 00:20:33,055
see you can really keep close tabs and
exactly what's happening while

387
00:20:33,082 --> 00:20:38,086
integrating which is really cool so so
take a few seconds to compile

388
00:20:38,086 --> 00:20:41,134
and once that's done it'll start running
tests on the iPad that we have connected

389
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:47,106
right here

390
00:20:48,006 --> 00:20:51,039
and I know you can't see it but it's
unlock the iPad

391
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,042
the app is launching

392
00:20:54,069 --> 00:20:57,086
and the Tessera

393
00:20:57,086 --> 00:21:00,161
and you can see we have been result for
integration that has completed

394
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:04,112
are you can see that because multiple
people have committed

395
00:21:05,012 --> 00:21:09,035
a to the repository for this integration
we have a nice break down

396
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:13,036
all the chametz and we have these nice
little circles which indicate

397
00:21:13,045 --> 00:21:16,052
relative to each committer how much
about integration Bay

398
00:21:17,015 --> 00:21:20,028
own so to speak it's the number files
that have been changed

399
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:23,097
and if I click on a computer I can see
which commits were made

400
00:21:23,097 --> 00:21:26,103
by those commuters which is pretty cool
but because a single integration

401
00:21:27,057 --> 00:21:30,105
isn't that exciting we're gonna switch
over to our other machine

402
00:21:31,005 --> 00:21:36,021
which has bought that's been baking for
a few days

403
00:21:36,021 --> 00:21:39,103
Sep you can see this but has been
running for quite a while

404
00:21:40,003 --> 00:21:43,060
I've gotten taller next this file has
been running for quite a while and it's

405
00:21:43,006 --> 00:21:45,023
got a much more interesting history

406
00:21:45,077 --> 00:21:48,165
arm which is a great way for us to show
off another new feature that we're

407
00:21:49,065 --> 00:21:50,106
really excited about which there

408
00:21:51,006 --> 00:21:55,033
issue tracking feature sofa select
integration number four

409
00:21:55,033 --> 00:21:58,882
you can see that shows we have no errors
one warning one analysis issue

410
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:03,610
and six tests ran successfully but these
warnings and issues

411
00:22:03,061 --> 00:22:07,100
our new women in this integration and
you can see that Xcode server smart

412
00:22:07,649 --> 00:22:09,654
enough to notice that because it puts a
plus-one

413
00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:13,690
under each in those circles so that we
know that these were just recently

414
00:22:13,069 --> 00:22:13,137
introduced

415
00:22:14,037 --> 00:22:17,082
and you can see here in the issue
summary it also says new issues

416
00:22:17,082 --> 00:22:22,113
one warning one out this issue well I
came along and fix that warning

417
00:22:23,013 --> 00:22:26,060
so an integration 5 you can see that it
says

418
00:22:26,006 --> 00:22:30,094
resolved issues morning on use variable
and knows based on the file location of

419
00:22:31,048 --> 00:22:31,126
these issues

420
00:22:32,026 --> 00:22:35,063
and the message that the issues
generated that this is exactly the same

421
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:35,612
issue

422
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:39,810
and we can safely say that this issue
has been resolved so that's really great

423
00:22:39,081 --> 00:22:41,113
way to keep an eye on the health of your
store space

424
00:22:42,013 --> 00:22:45,056
really really cool we also have here

425
00:22:45,056 --> 00:22:49,059
logs just like you would see for local
projects integrated in Xcode

426
00:22:49,059 --> 00:22:52,112
and you can even drill down into them
and see the same kinda view that you

427
00:22:53,012 --> 00:22:54,801
would expect from looking at these

428
00:22:54,909 --> 00:22:57,961
from a local product which is really
cool

429
00:22:58,429 --> 00:23:02,340
but now I wanna show you probably what
was be most requested feature from

430
00:23:02,034 --> 00:23:05,075
the first person experts Arbor which is
triggers

431
00:23:05,075 --> 00:23:08,146
triggers a really cool and we're really
excited to show you what they can do

432
00:23:09,046 --> 00:23:12,054
so we'll start by talking about how we
work with them on our team

433
00:23:12,054 --> 00:23:15,095
we have a friend his name is Jeeves

434
00:23:15,095 --> 00:23:18,174
and he sits in our messages chat room
all day long answering useful

435
00:23:19,074 --> 00:23:23,080
questions for us like what's the weather
like

436
00:23:23,008 --> 00:23:27,053
for instance you can see in Cupertino it
seventy 70 degrees and partly cloudy

437
00:23:28,025 --> 00:23:31,032
I of course here in the beautiful city
of San Francisco

438
00:23:31,095 --> 00:23:34,102
it is a good 12 degrees colder which is
to be expected

439
00:23:35,002 --> 00:23:38,009
are but Jesus really helpful we really
like having him around and it's very

440
00:23:38,072 --> 00:23:41,095
helpful to our team to be able to get
that kind of information on the fly

441
00:23:41,095 --> 00:23:44,129
but we want to supercharge this with
information from Xcode server

442
00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:48,168
and the best way to do that is with
traders

443
00:23:48,429 --> 00:23:53,700
so we'll switch over and Xcode have put
that up so you can see it side by side

444
00:23:53,007 --> 00:23:56,456
I'm gonna at the bar and most in the
settings I'm going to leave the same

445
00:23:57,149 --> 00:23:59,280
because we're not really changing much
about the Bach

446
00:23:59,028 --> 00:24:02,897
and you'll see as i click Next it will
re validate those credentials that

447
00:24:03,149 --> 00:24:06,830
except earlier to make sure nothing is
broken in the meantime

448
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:09,175
will leave all that information the same
but when we get to the trigger screen

449
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:13,148
I'll choose at trigger and select run
script

450
00:24:14,048 --> 00:24:18,207
now I've already got some triggers
written down here this is a ruby script

451
00:24:18,639 --> 00:24:21,642
bare shell script by the fall but you
can put a little

452
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:25,742
I should bang at the front here and run
using whatever interpreted like

453
00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:30,550
and all this does it hits a NAACP and
point that we expose

454
00:24:30,055 --> 00:24:33,152
on Jeeves I and it uses things like the
integration number

455
00:24:34,052 --> 00:24:37,101
and the bot name to build a message that
we're showing our chat room

456
00:24:38,001 --> 00:24:42,004
so all select all of that and paste into
a trigger

457
00:24:42,031 --> 00:24:45,104
I'm gonna do the same for post
integration trigger

458
00:24:46,004 --> 00:24:48,082
and these are just a little bit
different you can see I actually use the

459
00:24:48,082 --> 00:24:48,163
failure count

460
00:24:49,063 --> 00:24:52,129
our account warning count said we can
provide even more information on our

461
00:24:53,029 --> 00:24:54,033
chat room

462
00:24:54,033 --> 00:24:57,097
and proposed integration triggers you
get a choice up what condition under

463
00:24:57,097 --> 00:25:00,146
what conditions your trigger will run
whether it's only on success

464
00:25:01,046 --> 00:25:04,113
only when something goes wrong or any
combination house

465
00:25:05,013 --> 00:25:09,022
so I create the triggers arches update
and then to kick off a new immigration

466
00:25:09,022 --> 00:25:11,023
ever bop

467
00:25:11,023 --> 00:25:15,182
so put the status here and you can see

468
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:19,190
we gonna message in our chat room
immigration 49 coffee board is now

469
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:19,968
starting

470
00:25:20,139 --> 00:25:23,215
and that message ran after the source
code check out happened

471
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:26,950
so that way if you'd like to for
instance inject versioning information

472
00:25:27,409 --> 00:25:28,458
into your bill product

473
00:25:28,899 --> 00:25:31,830
you can do that right from a pre
integration trigger which we think is

474
00:25:31,083 --> 00:25:33,087
really cool

475
00:25:33,087 --> 00:25:36,088
you can see the innovation completed and
we got yet another into

476
00:25:36,088 --> 00:25:40,106
in job information message in our chat
room because want to take it

477
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:45,037
just one little step further we had
another little feature we can say

478
00:25:45,037 --> 00:25:48,052
Jeeves ok not whether Jeeves

479
00:25:48,052 --> 00:25:51,191
integrate coffee court

480
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:54,980
and you can see is kicking off another
integration exco which we think is

481
00:25:54,098 --> 00:25:57,507
pretty cool

482
00:25:58,389 --> 00:26:01,810
so that's just one of the many things
that you can do with triggers where sure

483
00:26:01,081 --> 00:26:04,420
you have ideas about how you want
integrate them into your own workflow

484
00:26:05,149 --> 00:26:09,149
are we have a lab right after the
session come see us come talk to us

485
00:26:09,149 --> 00:26:12,370
and we can help you make sure that you
can make triggers do whatever you would

486
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:12,099
like

487
00:26:12,099 --> 00:26:15,172
I thanks so much Brent back to you

488
00:26:16,072 --> 00:26:19,073
so of course the big news this week
switch support

489
00:26:19,082 --> 00:26:23,421
so how's execute server deal with swept
well deals with it just like it deals

490
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:25,186
with objective-c

491
00:26:25,429 --> 00:26:28,690
it as complete feature parity with
objective-c projects so whether you have

492
00:26:28,069 --> 00:26:29,107
pictures with project

493
00:26:30,007 --> 00:26:33,596
with you have a mixed swift in
objective-c product there's good server

494
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:38,350
in every box other projects no problem
all the features work the same

495
00:26:38,035 --> 00:26:41,103
this is true testing supports whether
you write unit tests in objective-c

496
00:26:42,003 --> 00:26:45,019
or your item in swift all the testing
support just works

497
00:26:45,019 --> 00:26:49,037
the same goes for performance testing an
expert there is always had great

498
00:26:49,037 --> 00:26:53,306
assistant editor integration in Xcode it
still doesn't of course that works just

499
00:26:53,639 --> 00:26:55,030
as well for swift code

500
00:26:55,003 --> 00:26:58,075
as it does for objective-c code

501
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:01,158
we'll talk about performance testing

502
00:27:02,058 --> 00:27:05,102
this is another great thing we released
this week and if you haven't heard any

503
00:27:06,002 --> 00:27:06,096
the talks yep

504
00:27:06,096 --> 00:27:09,097
I recommend to go out go back in
washington there's a session this

505
00:27:09,097 --> 00:27:10,103
morning about testing

506
00:27:11,057 --> 00:27:14,098
and processing is is pretty great its
and what we've

507
00:27:14,098 --> 00:27:17,196
minute really simple arm

508
00:27:18,096 --> 00:27:21,124
the great thing about it in the context
of Xcode server is that when you write a

509
00:27:22,024 --> 00:27:23,059
performance test

510
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:26,120
you can have expert server run that test
on multiple devices

511
00:27:27,002 --> 00:27:30,017
so this is this is really great so you
may be surprised to find that your code

512
00:27:30,035 --> 00:27:31,130
runs a lot slower on one device

513
00:27:32,003 --> 00:27:35,007
11 operating system and you expected it
to

514
00:27:35,007 --> 00:27:38,023
and server it's really easy to see this

515
00:27:38,086 --> 00:27:40,905
the key thing about performance testing
is that they work great on the box you

516
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,610
can just write your code in a measure
block

517
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:46,134
I you don't have to set a baseline but
if you set a baseline you get a lot more

518
00:27:47,034 --> 00:27:48,070
value out of them

519
00:27:48,007 --> 00:27:51,070
anything with baseline does he have to
set them on a protest heard about per

520
00:27:52,033 --> 00:27:52,101
device

521
00:27:53,001 --> 00:27:56,140
basis so that looks something like this:

522
00:27:56,149 --> 00:27:59,480
we have this report you can see all the
tests here you can see I have a couple

523
00:27:59,048 --> 00:28:01,052
different devices that these tests are
running on

524
00:28:01,088 --> 00:28:05,096
and I in order to get more value of
these need to set a baseline

525
00:28:05,096 --> 00:28:08,110
for each test which device this is the
UI that does that

526
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:13,050
we'll see more about in a minute so case
this is new to you

527
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:16,830
this is this is what a performance test
looks like it's really simple

528
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:18,892
this is what it looks like in
objective-c any code in the metabolic

529
00:28:19,639 --> 00:28:21,510
here's gonna get executed

530
00:28:21,051 --> 00:28:25,110
ten times sarisi and swift

531
00:28:26,001 --> 00:28:29,028
we have

532
00:28:29,037 --> 00:28:32,045
also a measure block

533
00:28:32,045 --> 00:28:35,053
factory closure but its so called matter
block that's the API

534
00:28:35,053 --> 00:28:38,662
I it's the same thing so to show you all
this in action I'm gonna bring up my

535
00:28:39,139 --> 00:28:40,700
office mate Matt number two

536
00:28:40,007 --> 00:28:43,038
was allowed as keyboard I have ever
heard to show them a

537
00:28:44,001 --> 00:28:48,150
mama

538
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,990
thank you brent so I'm really excited to
be here today to share

539
00:28:51,099 --> 00:28:54,538
new Xcode server in Xcode sex with you
guys I'll

540
00:28:55,429 --> 00:28:58,620
support for swift art brand new
programming language

541
00:28:58,062 --> 00:29:01,871
an awesome new performance testing
features right so we have the eye with

542
00:29:02,429 --> 00:29:04,720
anywhere open with our coffee board
application

543
00:29:04,072 --> 00:29:08,088
ago list were here with me Matt Brent
and some of our friends

544
00:29:08,088 --> 00:29:12,133
and our balance is so looks like I've
got a negative balance

545
00:29:13,033 --> 00:29:16,056
I guess they are some people some coffee

546
00:29:16,056 --> 00:29:19,088
and here we see a list with exactly what
I own each person or what they owed to

547
00:29:19,088 --> 00:29:19,887
me

548
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:23,778
I think I remember brain causing me a
bad issue earlier in the week

549
00:29:24,669 --> 00:29:28,010
that cost me sometimes I forgot to add
that transaction

550
00:29:28,001 --> 00:29:32,650
I can do that right here and it'll get
added to the list

551
00:29:32,659 --> 00:29:35,940
now I'm worried bed as we keep adding
transactions we have

552
00:29:35,094 --> 00:29:39,095
some back and forth a on our team I'm
worried that as this grows

553
00:29:40,004 --> 00:29:43,010
that condensing these down into a nice
list for the UI

554
00:29:43,001 --> 00:29:46,310
is gonna get more time consuming so I
want to test the performance about make

555
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:46,810
sure

556
00:29:46,081 --> 00:29:49,158
it stays good as I keep adding to the
application

557
00:29:50,058 --> 00:29:54,113
and the performance testing feature next
good sex make it really easy to do

558
00:29:55,013 --> 00:29:59,812
to make with the simulator and switch
back to exco

559
00:29:59,929 --> 00:30:03,977
so here got an exit SK some class with a
buncha test making sure that

560
00:30:04,409 --> 00:30:08,830
the function I have for condensing down
these transactions works correctly

561
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:12,172
I think we all know there's more to a
great application just working correctly

562
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:16,090
customers expect great performance they
want your apt to be fast and get out of

563
00:30:16,009 --> 00:30:17,058
their way

564
00:30:17,139 --> 00:30:21,560
and performance testing feature will
help you make sure that that's the case

565
00:30:21,056 --> 00:30:26,061
some to add a new performance tester
application

566
00:30:26,061 --> 00:30:29,070
and I'm gonna go ahead and commit that
to my repository so that tax cuts are a

567
00:30:30,051 --> 00:30:37,051
concert integrating that

568
00:30:39,109 --> 00:30:42,840
push that up while it's doing that I'll
take a closer look at what the status is

569
00:30:42,084 --> 00:30:44,121
actually doing

570
00:30:45,021 --> 00:30:49,058
so it's just like any other unit assets
just method on your test exit SK some

571
00:30:49,058 --> 00:30:49,122
class

572
00:30:50,022 --> 00:30:54,026
starts with the word test takes no
arguments returns a value

573
00:30:54,026 --> 00:30:58,175
first thing we do is created mister
transactions that were gonna emerge

574
00:30:58,409 --> 00:31:01,481
and then I don't want to waste any time
measuring thats I do it outside been

575
00:31:02,129 --> 00:31:05,226
the measure block and Nathan except here
we call this measure block function

576
00:31:06,099 --> 00:31:10,590
and passionate closure and whatever code
inside there will run multiple times

577
00:31:10,059 --> 00:31:13,398
and measure the time each iteration and
average this together

578
00:31:13,929 --> 00:31:18,760
report that to you so I think our
integration is finish completing

579
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:21,104
some can go take a look at that now

580
00:31:22,004 --> 00:31:25,083
we have a this lovely test report that's
new in Xcode 6

581
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:28,760
breaks down exactly what happened in
each test I can see I'm

582
00:31:28,076 --> 00:31:31,147
performance tests is here in the list
I've got this new column for Time

583
00:31:32,047 --> 00:31:35,486
reports the average time that
generational a test set

584
00:31:35,909 --> 00:31:39,580
looks like this: 2.15 seconds on average

585
00:31:39,058 --> 00:31:42,133
that seems pretty good if I click that
time

586
00:31:43,033 --> 00:31:46,102
that I can see a breakdown by device
only got the one device plugged in right

587
00:31:47,002 --> 00:31:48,031
now but I can have several

588
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:51,570
they would each have their own time
measurements

589
00:31:51,849 --> 00:31:55,550
max could stymie something here telling
me that that we have no baseline

590
00:31:55,055 --> 00:31:58,152
for the time performance metric and
that's because when you first had a test

591
00:31:59,052 --> 00:32:00,681
a performance test

592
00:32:01,149 --> 00:32:05,470
excuse not to make any assumptions about
what's good performance and what's not

593
00:32:05,047 --> 00:32:08,074
because every test is unique and every
device is unique

594
00:32:08,074 --> 00:32:11,753
and we don't wanna make any presumptions
so we report the time for you

595
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:15,421
but we won't try to fail your test based
on how performs if you have any

596
00:32:15,619 --> 00:32:16,650
assertions and your tests

597
00:32:16,929 --> 00:32:19,948
or fail based on that but that

598
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:23,120
but when I keep working on this
application

599
00:32:23,129 --> 00:32:27,090
I wanna know if this performance get
gets worse i won X considerate to notify

600
00:32:27,009 --> 00:32:27,014
me

601
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:30,094
when that happens by failing my test and
to do that

602
00:32:30,094 --> 00:32:33,100
I can fit a baseline for this test

603
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,069
to do that I click the time for this
particular device

604
00:32:37,069 --> 00:32:40,080
I can't hit the set baseline

605
00:32:40,008 --> 00:32:43,060
and what happens when I click that
button is that Xcode

606
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:49,036
updates its project file with entries to
say for this particular test

607
00:32:49,072 --> 00:32:52,109
for this particular kind of device like
iPhone 5s

608
00:32:53,009 --> 00:32:57,798
iPhone 4s iPad that me that this is the
performance standard

609
00:32:57,879 --> 00:33:00,928
that if we significantly regressing get
slower than this

610
00:33:01,369 --> 00:33:05,220
number that should fail a test

611
00:33:05,022 --> 00:33:08,451
and the interesting thing about this
getting added to the project files

612
00:33:08,649 --> 00:33:12,580
is that they get committed source
control I'm gonna go ahead and do that

613
00:33:12,058 --> 00:33:13,069
now because I want our

614
00:33:13,069 --> 00:33:16,728
about to be able to use them you can see
these are just

615
00:33:17,349 --> 00:33:20,381
property list you can edit them by hand
if you want but we've got a nice UI and

616
00:33:20,669 --> 00:33:27,480
that s report for managing the space

617
00:33:27,048 --> 00:33:31,125
I'm gonna push that up Latics conserve
start integrating

618
00:33:32,025 --> 00:33:35,026
and while it's doing that we can look at
the test report here

619
00:33:35,026 --> 00:33:38,415
weekend we have a lot of filtering
options here like we can

620
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:43,260
show only failed test which I don't have
any of which is great

621
00:33:43,026 --> 00:33:46,405
if we want we can just focus on the
performance test like the one I just

622
00:33:46,639 --> 00:33:48,640
added

623
00:33:48,649 --> 00:33:51,651
if there's a particular test I'm
interest in looking at I can search by

624
00:33:51,849 --> 00:33:52,510
name

625
00:33:52,051 --> 00:33:56,180
fell to just SMS that name

626
00:33:56,639 --> 00:34:01,340
or if I'm interested and what I happen
what the code is for specific test

627
00:34:01,034 --> 00:34:08,034
I can click the Follow button here and
jump right to the code for that test

628
00:34:09,056 --> 00:34:14,915
now see what what's happening with about

629
00:34:15,419 --> 00:34:18,710
we can see exactly which tests it's
running america's

630
00:34:18,071 --> 00:34:23,970
and healthy what happens when a test run
when we have a baseline for

631
00:34:24,609 --> 00:34:29,020
so now I can see that this time our
tests ran a little bit worse

632
00:34:29,002 --> 00:34:33,075
and little bit longer than the baseline
that I set by testo passes because it's

633
00:34:33,075 --> 00:34:33,134
within a

634
00:34:34,034 --> 00:34:37,077
acceptable range we understand that
there's going to be fluctuations between

635
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:38,096
each test run

636
00:34:38,096 --> 00:34:43,245
and we don't want to fit fail over
zealously

637
00:34:44,109 --> 00:34:47,138
so let's see what happens when I
actually do introduce a significant

638
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:48,421
regression

639
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:51,667
some you switch back to the code that

640
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:55,440
handles merging these transactions

641
00:34:55,044 --> 00:34:58,075
now what I have here is clearly working
my tests are passing

642
00:34:58,075 --> 00:35:01,141
the performance tests are succeeding

643
00:35:02,041 --> 00:35:05,069
but I'm worried that later on when I
come back to look at this

644
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:08,128
I'm not really gonna understand what
this was doing I think I have an idea

645
00:35:09,028 --> 00:35:13,107
for how I can rewrite this function in a
way that makes more sense to me that I'd

646
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:16,130
understand better later

647
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:19,016
I'm just gonna be a little reckless
hearings committee right away because I

648
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:20,102
know Xcode server has my back

649
00:35:21,002 --> 00:35:24,088
if I break the application are fine make
it perform significantly worse

650
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:31,088
X cancer is gonna tell me and my entire
team

651
00:35:35,059 --> 00:35:39,144
I'll push that up let that start
integrating I'm really excited about

652
00:35:40,044 --> 00:35:41,099
this performance testing feature

653
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:44,183
but they can make your tests were close
lower

654
00:35:45,083 --> 00:35:48,122
so Xeon server give you a great way to

655
00:35:48,869 --> 00:35:52,790
I speak keep your speedy workflow but
still take advantage of these

656
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:52,138
performance

657
00:35:53,038 --> 00:35:57,083
s now that bill run slower because were
running several iterations

658
00:35:57,083 --> 00:36:01,152
ways on ideally significant work
otherwise and when the test

659
00:36:02,052 --> 00:36:05,113
so you can set up an one scheme Xcode
server runs

660
00:36:06,013 --> 00:36:09,099
that runs all your tests including your
performance tests and another one to run

661
00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:09,165
locally

662
00:36:10,065 --> 00:36:13,106
just rancher quicker once to get the
best of both worlds

663
00:36:14,006 --> 00:36:18,012
I think I saw gf's tell me that my
integrationist on

664
00:36:18,066 --> 00:36:21,072
on our looks like I have some failing
tests

665
00:36:22,026 --> 00:36:25,375
I guess that new merge function wasn't
as good as the old one

666
00:36:25,609 --> 00:36:29,050
looks like it is performing a hundred
and thirty-seven percent worse

667
00:36:29,005 --> 00:36:32,033
that's pretty bad I don't wanna ship bad
when we

668
00:36:32,033 --> 00:36:36,091
when we ship our application but I'm a
little busy to fix a renowned

669
00:36:36,091 --> 00:36:39,120
busy giving at WWDC presentation so

670
00:36:40,002 --> 00:36:43,661
I'm gonna trust that our notifications
let my team know and that someone else

671
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:44,930
will take care fixing

672
00:36:44,093 --> 00:36:47,114
I

673
00:36:48,014 --> 00:36:51,015
Matt go ahead and high tax code have one
more thing

674
00:36:51,024 --> 00:36:55,092
I wanna show you guys so last year when
we introduce expense over

675
00:36:55,092 --> 00:36:58,180
we gave a great way to give high
visibility to what all your box we're

676
00:36:59,008 --> 00:36:59,061
doing

677
00:37:00,033 --> 00:37:03,122
inside your office and we called the big
screen and we have a new

678
00:37:04,022 --> 00:37:07,024
beautifully updated version a big screen
I'd like to show you now

679
00:37:07,042 --> 00:37:14,042
so this is a new big-screen

680
00:37:15,007 --> 00:37:18,013
along the left side you can see we have
a list about

681
00:37:18,067 --> 00:37:22,075
these are all the box configured on our
server we got a little punny

682
00:37:23,047 --> 00:37:27,696
on our team ICANN fee that below each
but name

683
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:32,750
we have icons indicating what kinda
issues we might have on those pots

684
00:37:32,075 --> 00:37:36,128
so coffee board is clearly has test
failures in a performance regression

685
00:37:37,028 --> 00:37:40,043
about it looks like someone started into

686
00:37:40,043 --> 00:37:43,972
at started new integration on their out
somebody came along and fix my mistake

687
00:37:44,359 --> 00:37:47,920
now when we focus on each pot

688
00:37:47,092 --> 00:37:50,123
show account so airs warnings

689
00:37:51,023 --> 00:37:54,106
analysis issues test or test failures
that some are failing

690
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:59,065
even show the change in that both
numbers from the previous integration

691
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,217
along the bottom you can see both the
committers

692
00:38:03,099 --> 00:38:07,380
and you can see even if they we have
issues that we've attributed to them

693
00:38:07,038 --> 00:38:12,051
how many those might have they might
have and looks like coffee board finish

694
00:38:12,051 --> 00:38:15,094
integrating our tests are now passing
which is great looks like somebody came

695
00:38:15,094 --> 00:38:17,100
along affects my mistake looks like it
was the other Matt

696
00:38:18,054 --> 00:38:21,883
so applause for him but

697
00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:27,442
and that's the new big-screen

698
00:38:28,099 --> 00:38:31,123
that I've got to show a are handed back
to Breck thank you

699
00:38:31,339 --> 00:38:34,970
thanks Matt

700
00:38:34,097 --> 00:38:37,156
mother great demos by two great guys
both at the same name

701
00:38:38,056 --> 00:38:43,585
sup in summary

702
00:38:44,089 --> 00:38:47,450
we've got a great new foundation in this
version: second server

703
00:38:47,045 --> 00:38:50,126
got tons a bug fixes and other
improvements please keep sending us your

704
00:38:51,026 --> 00:38:52,635
feedback we are listening

705
00:38:52,869 --> 00:38:55,960
and we've got great great new features
like

706
00:38:55,096 --> 00:39:01,132
in flight progress notification so you
can see exactly what your body is doing

707
00:39:02,032 --> 00:39:03,032
when it is raining

708
00:39:03,032 --> 00:39:06,126
we have issue tracking so conservative
tell you when issue was introduced

709
00:39:07,026 --> 00:39:10,122
if it still exists who introduced the
issue and finally when it was resolved

710
00:39:11,022 --> 00:39:14,038
this gives you a great sense of the
overall health of your project

711
00:39:14,038 --> 00:39:17,081
we have a great new testing

712
00:39:17,081 --> 00:39:21,116
are test result are you why including
support for performance testing

713
00:39:22,016 --> 00:39:26,105
a really easy way to set baselines for
tests for individual devices

714
00:39:27,005 --> 00:39:31,009
and of course we have awesome support
for triggers

715
00:39:31,045 --> 00:39:35,954
so I've got lab right after this here's
more information if you need to come to

716
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:36,880
the lab

717
00:39:36,088 --> 00:39:39,125
and maybe even try to out to address and
write something even more awesome than

718
00:39:40,025 --> 00:39:43,098
our friend Jeeves comment so that's it
thank you

719
00:39:43,098 --> 00:39:43,150
have been weak
