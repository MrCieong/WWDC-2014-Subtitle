1
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:16,260
good morning welcome to BBC in this is

2
00:00:16,026 --> 00:00:19,965
new in the tax code

3
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:24,630
yes our a lot of new stuff yesterday
today

4
00:00:24,063 --> 00:00:27,852
we thought we would take a deep dive
into a few specific areas

5
00:00:28,419 --> 00:00:32,860
have Xcode6 before we do though

6
00:00:32,086 --> 00:00:35,137
let's take a look at what happens with
what time that we were here together

7
00:00:36,037 --> 00:00:40,064
I hope you guys are using and enjoying
its good 5.1

8
00:00:40,064 --> 00:00:45,065
since last year

9
00:00:45,065 --> 00:00:48,116
one of the biggest new things that we
added with support for

10
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:55,110
I laugh 64-bit and you have an amazing
job adopting 64-bit your apt

11
00:00:56,001 --> 00:00:59,017
to take full advantage of our latest
devices

12
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:05,925
we've also made significant improvements
for our layout in Interface Builder

13
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:11,710
and added new API's to make your own
classes work with the bugger pick work

14
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:15,096
this fall

15
00:01:15,096 --> 00:01:22,096
will be releasing Xcode sex with an even
more beautiful and functional interface

16
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:29,979
to go along with with 10 yosemite let's
take a quick look at some of the new

17
00:01:30,032 --> 00:01:31,076
features an ex had sex

18
00:01:31,076 --> 00:01:37,133
first of all we have a brand new
programming language for Copa

19
00:01:38,033 --> 00:01:39,037
development called swept

20
00:01:39,073 --> 00:01:42,167
and sweaters etc reading up on its own

21
00:01:43,067 --> 00:01:49,083
but we didn't stop there playgrounds
provide alive and responsive environment

22
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:50,105
for you to develop code

23
00:01:51,005 --> 00:01:55,039
whether you're exploring new
technologies like stray cat physics

24
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:55,878
courses

25
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:59,890
or just playing around with swift itself
you're going to love

26
00:01:59,089 --> 00:02:05,178
the experience to play perhaps
playgrounds also offer

27
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:10,131
a great learning environment the swift
language guided tour

28
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:14,048
is actually a playground where you can
try things out

29
00:02:14,048 --> 00:02:19,807
right as you're reading and learning
about swept and of course

30
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:26,370
swiftest fully integrated into Xcode
everything from code completion

31
00:02:26,037 --> 00:02:29,073
to connect from source in Interface
Builder works beautifully with swept

32
00:02:29,073 --> 00:02:33,052
when you're working in swept

33
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:37,771
Xcode knows if you have to see the
interface for framework laughs

34
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:43,393
actual show it to you in swept and when
you after a quick help

35
00:02:43,969 --> 00:02:50,969
you get help in swept a quick up
actually had another new track

36
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:57,292
0 messed up that build to

37
00:02:57,499 --> 00:03:01,040
it we have another new track that works
well with sweats and inferred pipes

38
00:03:01,004 --> 00:03:04,007
if you're ever curious about what type
is being inferred

39
00:03:04,034 --> 00:03:11,034
by swept quick up can tell you and

40
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:16,090
you can freely make swept into your
existing objective-c applications

41
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:19,014
will be showing you how easy that is

42
00:03:19,059 --> 00:03:26,059
in a few minutes now let's talk about

43
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:31,870
some other tax codes design tools and
the new features their

44
00:03:31,087 --> 00:03:36,906
you're probably all familiar with using
storyboards and develop your I OS

45
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:37,780
applications

46
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:42,646
an Xcode sex you can use to reports
develop your life can applications as

47
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:43,114
well

48
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,611
NIOS

49
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:50,650
the new adopted by:

50
00:03:50,065 --> 00:03:53,764
let you have a single story board for
universal applications

51
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:59,400
while still retaining foale control over
customizing your interface for both

52
00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:00,861
iPhone and iPad

53
00:04:01,059 --> 00:04:06,980
and if you use custom pancho your
application

54
00:04:06,098 --> 00:04:10,126
you can now see them right on the campus
and Interface Builder

55
00:04:11,026 --> 00:04:18,026
we have some brand new

56
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:23,781
level editor editors in Xcode 62

57
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:27,990
like thus make it level editor that lets
you visually a sample seems

58
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:34,099
active sex has a brand new way to
localize your applications

59
00:04:35,004 --> 00:04:40,005
you can export call your local liable
content into actually

60
00:04:40,005 --> 00:04:43,016
which is the industry standard format
that's understood by a lot of

61
00:04:43,061 --> 00:04:44,087
translation services

62
00:04:44,087 --> 00:04:47,130
and when you get those translations back

63
00:04:48,003 --> 00:04:51,097
just import an actual will help you to
merge Latin content

64
00:04:52,024 --> 00:04:56,423
right into your project

65
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,667
and with Iowa State's support for
frameworks

66
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:07,690
you can now build ID components just by
adding a few attributes to your classes

67
00:05:07,069 --> 00:05:10,069
you can get them to show operate in
Ivy's campus

68
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:13,608
and configure them in the inspector

69
00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:18,251
will be showing you how easy it is to
make your views

70
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:24,150
into I B components

71
00:05:24,015 --> 00:05:29,068
out actual sex makes debugging better
than ever

72
00:05:29,068 --> 00:05:33,106
often when you're debugging the using
cues

73
00:05:34,006 --> 00:05:38,105
it's not quite enough just to see the
code that's running on the Q

74
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,007
so an excuse sex we now show you

75
00:05:42,025 --> 00:05:47,108
how about block caught on to the Q also

76
00:05:48,008 --> 00:05:52,015
when you're developing the new app
extensions departing support is

77
00:05:52,015 --> 00:05:55,019
easy and automatic for example appeared

78
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:58,134
developing it to debut extension just
hit run Xcode

79
00:05:59,034 --> 00:06:03,233
bring up notification center on the
device an actual automatically attach to

80
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:04,370
your extension

81
00:06:04,037 --> 00:06:08,040
for debugging

82
00:06:08,004 --> 00:06:11,773
X good sex have some brand new debug
ages

83
00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:15,930
to help you identify problems with desk
and file i/o

84
00:06:15,093 --> 00:06:19,180
this game that work I'll

85
00:06:20,008 --> 00:06:25,847
and viewed about going gives you deep
inside individual problems

86
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,642
will be showing you how easy it is to
identify and fix problems with your view

87
00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:31,712
hierarchy and constraints

88
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:36,161
using view the bike

89
00:06:36,719 --> 00:06:40,520
exco sex has some all-new

90
00:06:40,052 --> 00:06:43,411
performance features as well

91
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:49,885
that will help you to make your app's
faster and leader

92
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,504
our premier performance will instruments
has a brand new interface

93
00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:58,810
with the new workflows that make it
easier than ever to analyzer app

94
00:06:58,081 --> 00:07:03,130
performance

95
00:07:04,003 --> 00:07:07,592
last year we introduce tax code server
and one of the biggest request that we

96
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:07,938
got

97
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:12,080
was for the ability to customize what
happens when you're running continuous

98
00:07:12,008 --> 00:07:13,657
integration

99
00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:17,830
so an excuse sex we've added support for
traders to allow you to

100
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:22,222
to add custom behavior to your boss

101
00:07:22,969 --> 00:07:26,830
and we've added support in the actually
pass for a more

102
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:31,792
in Xcode am in Xcode server for
performance casts

103
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:37,020
its easy to make a performance past you
just wrap your code

104
00:07:37,002 --> 00:07:41,371
in a measure block performance pass

105
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:44,475
what Xcode measure the speed your code

106
00:07:45,249 --> 00:07:49,347
and tell you whenever it has improved
regressed

107
00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:53,276
and in order to help you to make your
apt even faster

108
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:58,793
you can now profile your performance
passed directly in instruments

109
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:06,639
with just a choice from this context
menu

110
00:08:09,059 --> 00:08:16,059
it from little things right Xcode also
includes all new reports

111
00:08:16,071 --> 00:08:20,152
that show you exactly higher performance
tests are doing and world

112
00:08:21,052 --> 00:08:25,086
will be showing you how easy it is to
start writing performance pass for your

113
00:08:25,086 --> 00:08:25,161
projects

114
00:08:26,061 --> 00:08:31,085
and using them to make your out better
so that's just

115
00:08:31,085 --> 00:08:35,088
a quick two were have some love the
feature areas in Xcode sex and now we'd

116
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:36,021
like to die

117
00:08:36,075 --> 00:08:39,994
diving deeper and give you a detailed
look and a few other things

118
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:43,790
areas to get us started with that

119
00:08:43,079 --> 00:08:49,131
let me introduce Daniel dunbar thanks
Mike

120
00:08:50,031 --> 00:08:55,031
this talk is called what's new in Xcode
and obviously the big new thing this

121
00:08:55,031 --> 00:08:55,095
year

122
00:08:55,095 --> 00:08:59,132
it swept I'm sure you're all really
excited about this new language we

123
00:09:00,032 --> 00:09:01,041
unveiled yesterday

124
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:05,063
I imagine many are wondering how quickly
can I start using this

125
00:09:05,063 --> 00:09:10,087
my own applications so like to kick off
our team is this morning

126
00:09:10,087 --> 00:09:13,164
by showing you just how easy it is
integrates with into an existing

127
00:09:14,064 --> 00:09:17,100
application we've created this new

128
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,042
photo scavenger gay let me show it to
you now a game

129
00:09:22,042 --> 00:09:26,090
is called shutterbugs when I open it up
miltie

130
00:09:26,009 --> 00:09:30,066
a game start with this great looking
fine on screen that take the user right

131
00:09:31,047 --> 00:09:33,129
into the game that's been working great

132
00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:37,084
better app has really been taking off
recently and users tell us

133
00:09:37,084 --> 00:09:42,086
they want to be able to play multiple
games at one time so for version two

134
00:09:42,086 --> 00:09:45,179
we'd like to introduce a new games
landing screen that shows users there in

135
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:46,153
progress

136
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:50,145
and complete games and of course we'd
like to do it and swept

137
00:09:51,045 --> 00:09:54,108
now my designers RT updated the
storyboard

138
00:09:55,008 --> 00:09:58,037
to include this tableview controller
shown here

139
00:09:58,037 --> 00:10:02,080
all we need to do to finish off this new
feature implement the code for

140
00:10:02,008 --> 00:10:07,093
so I know I'm gonna eventually want to
cut themselves class for my table

141
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:11,130
so start with that in a goat abuse

142
00:10:12,003 --> 00:10:15,079
and select new file from the pop-up menu
a course

143
00:10:16,006 --> 00:10:21,073
I wanna I O S Cocoa Touch glass and the
first thing you'll notice on the screen

144
00:10:21,073 --> 00:10:24,087
that there's a new language user at the
bottom the let you

145
00:10:24,087 --> 00:10:27,094
decide whether you want a swift or in
Objective C Class

146
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:30,112
course I want swept and in this case

147
00:10:31,012 --> 00:10:34,085
I wanna subclass buit will be cell a
call it

148
00:10:34,085 --> 00:10:38,127
games table view cell job that in my
project

149
00:10:39,027 --> 00:10:42,104
annex could take me to the source the
subclass template

150
00:10:43,004 --> 00:10:47,013
are a great way to get started with the
new language so

151
00:10:47,094 --> 00:10:50,100
for us the main thing will need it a
couple

152
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,038
up properties that we can use to connect
Ruit

153
00:10:54,038 --> 00:10:58,056
so let me add that to start with as you
can see

154
00:10:58,056 --> 00:11:02,060
property declarations in sweat are very
clean and simple

155
00:11:02,006 --> 00:11:06,087
and we just needed to add this ID outlet
attributes so that we could connect to

156
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:07,069
it

157
00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:10,073
from Interface Builder now that's in
place

158
00:11:10,073 --> 00:11:17,073
let me go back to my storyboard so

159
00:11:17,095 --> 00:11:21,158
also like Mike prototype cell and I need
to associate a class with

160
00:11:22,058 --> 00:11:26,154
by pulled on that menu either in its
base builder has already recognized our

161
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:29,121
new class using are swept indexing
support

162
00:11:30,021 --> 00:11:34,038
just like games table view cell you may
notice

163
00:11:34,038 --> 00:11:37,047
there's a new model field here another
great way

164
00:11:38,028 --> 00:11:41,035
that Swift improve the coding experience
is by officiating classes

165
00:11:41,098 --> 00:11:45,116
with the models that their declared in
that allows he short

166
00:11:46,016 --> 00:11:49,054
comfortable class names while still
ensuring that your classes

167
00:11:49,054 --> 00:11:54,060
won't collide across targets and project
with that in place

168
00:11:55,014 --> 00:12:00,018
we can set up our our connections a
close the utilities panel

169
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:05,056
and open our source code in the
assistant editor and now

170
00:12:05,074 --> 00:12:08,141
I can I can wire at my connections just
like you would expect

171
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:12,055
set the name the state labor law

172
00:12:12,055 --> 00:12:15,099
and we have a custom progress here yet

173
00:12:15,099 --> 00:12:18,113
that should be enough to let us get
started with our custom cell

174
00:12:19,013 --> 00:12:25,082
now let's fill in the details of the
Comptroller re-added the basic subclass

175
00:12:25,082 --> 00:12:25,141
template

176
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:30,058
with that with a couple tweaks but we
need to fill in the details

177
00:12:30,058 --> 00:12:33,091
so the first thing that every controller
class need

178
00:12:33,091 --> 00:12:36,169
is access to the model data that it's
going to present

179
00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:40,078
for our application most of our model
data is stored

180
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:47,078
in a user session class let me at a
property to hold that now

181
00:12:49,031 --> 00:12:53,065
I'll call it user session and declare
its tight

182
00:12:53,065 --> 00:12:56,088
naturally we have live issue support in
sweat

183
00:12:56,088 --> 00:12:59,104
and BiPAP this open I can see felony

184
00:13:00,004 --> 00:13:03,056
there's an undeclared type here user
session

185
00:13:03,056 --> 00:13:07,057
haven't imported that class yet now in
swift

186
00:13:07,066 --> 00:13:11,101
all the classes in one target are
automatically visible

187
00:13:12,001 --> 00:13:15,076
each on the source miss wit
implementation piles

188
00:13:15,076 --> 00:13:18,080
you no longer need to worry about
manually importing the headers

189
00:13:19,016 --> 00:13:22,016
for each other classes that you use

190
00:13:22,016 --> 00:13:26,081
get

191
00:13:26,081 --> 00:13:29,137
however you do still need to import the
modules

192
00:13:30,037 --> 00:13:34,043
for the framework that you depend upon
to go along with I O estate

193
00:13:34,097 --> 00:13:37,140
new framework support Xcode now has
support

194
00:13:38,004 --> 00:13:41,943
for unit to find models Arab your own
frameworks

195
00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:46,376
and those models can be used in both
swept and objective-c

196
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:50,540
we party state started taking advantage
to that in our application

197
00:13:50,054 --> 00:13:55,055
by moving all over model code: into this
new core shutterbugs framework

198
00:13:55,064 --> 00:13:58,065
vacancy

199
00:13:58,074 --> 00:14:01,082
that means to use this in my proctor to
fix this problem

200
00:14:02,054 --> 00:14:06,097
all I need to do is tight import core
shutterbugs

201
00:14:06,097 --> 00:14:09,104
just like I would for any other
framework on the system

202
00:14:10,004 --> 00:14:13,087
and of course the air goes away

203
00:14:13,087 --> 00:14:16,138
now our table view is gonna have two
different sections

204
00:14:17,038 --> 00:14:21,067
by 11 per the in progress games and then
one for the complete games

205
00:14:21,067 --> 00:14:24,126
so I want to start by creating utility
method but let me easily get

206
00:14:25,026 --> 00:14:30,045
the appropriate lists for each section

207
00:14:30,045 --> 00:14:34,113
I'm gonna call it game list for section
and what I want to return here

208
00:14:35,013 --> 00:14:38,077
is the result up user sessions

209
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:41,142
get filter game last night you can see
that

210
00:14:42,042 --> 00:14:45,110
even though this is a method that we
declared in our objectives the source

211
00:14:46,001 --> 00:14:46,047
code

212
00:14:46,056 --> 00:14:49,058
in another framework I still get code
completion and

213
00:14:49,058 --> 00:14:53,115
even the documentation for that method
in mice with source code

214
00:14:54,015 --> 00:14:58,018
so complete that out and what I want to
get is the in progress list

215
00:14:58,045 --> 00:15:01,074
when the section number 0

216
00:15:01,074 --> 00:15:06,117
I'm also gonna add a cast here to a
gamer it

217
00:15:07,017 --> 00:15:11,019
what I'm doing here is taking advantage
ups with tight collection support

218
00:15:11,037 --> 00:15:14,106
the tell the compiler that each object
in this array

219
00:15:15,006 --> 00:15:19,905
is an instance at the gate my game class
that way whenever I use this array later

220
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:20,900
in the code

221
00:15:20,009 --> 00:15:24,014
was with compiler will know the exact
height each object

222
00:15:25,004 --> 00:15:29,313
one more utility I'd like in a table
view you frequently want to get the data

223
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:31,800
associated with a particular cell

224
00:15:31,008 --> 00:15:34,057
an accel as represented by an index to
so created

225
00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:40,038
up a method that lets me easily get the
game for a particular index

226
00:15:40,038 --> 00:15:43,081
in a call that one game for index Pat
and it returns an

227
00:15:43,081 --> 00:15:46,145
option on getting with those methods in
place

228
00:15:47,045 --> 00:15:50,097
should be easy to write our table the
datasource

229
00:15:50,097 --> 00:15:53,173
let me drop at it

230
00:15:54,073 --> 00:15:58,097
what I'm doing here setting the number
sections to be too

231
00:15:58,097 --> 00:16:01,175
I'm gonna return an appropriate number
rose for each section

232
00:16:02,075 --> 00:16:07,077
using that first utility method yet and
are used game for index pack

233
00:16:07,077 --> 00:16:11,132
to easily get the particular game and
then propagate its data into our custom

234
00:16:12,032 --> 00:16:12,097
cell

235
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:16,101
whenever we need to DQ a new cell

236
00:16:17,037 --> 00:16:20,118
and also added to prepare for Segway
matted to set up a destination view

237
00:16:21,018 --> 00:16:21,101
controllers

238
00:16:22,001 --> 00:16:26,080
when the transition happens okay we're
almost done

239
00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:29,860
but I'd like to do one more thing before
we call a controller

240
00:16:29,086 --> 00:16:33,093
rap you can see that I'm Rd modifying
the separator

241
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:38,098
inset on this table to to give our table
a little bit of a custom look

242
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:41,207
that's alright but I've just heard about
I O S 8

243
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:47,160
new separator affect property I'd like
to try it out here

244
00:16:47,016 --> 00:16:50,099
I know that it's called tableview that
separator

245
00:16:50,099 --> 00:16:54,162
fact but I can't remember exact object
and i'm suppose two assigned to that

246
00:16:55,062 --> 00:16:56,521
property

247
00:16:57,079 --> 00:17:00,350
when X good six it we jumped a
definition

248
00:17:00,035 --> 00:17:04,774
it'll take us right to you a table view
but it's rendered in swept

249
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:08,280
even though this is actually in
Objective C header in the system

250
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:08,112
framework

251
00:17:09,012 --> 00:17:13,211
Xcode has dynamically translated it to
the swift interface just like the

252
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:15,050
compiler would see

253
00:17:15,005 --> 00:17:18,014
and even though this is happening on the
fly we take great care

254
00:17:18,014 --> 00:17:22,323
to preserve all other API comment that
you need to use these libraries

255
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:24,280
effectively

256
00:17:24,028 --> 00:17:27,063
now that I'm here I can see that
separator a fact

257
00:17:27,063 --> 00:17:30,095
is a UI visual effect if I navigate on

258
00:17:30,095 --> 00:17:34,110
on words that up now I remember

259
00:17:35,001 --> 00:17:39,068
what I want the %um vibrancy of that
munies a dark color style to go with

260
00:17:39,077 --> 00:17:40,125
that

261
00:17:41,025 --> 00:17:46,102
so let me add that Micah

262
00:17:47,002 --> 00:17:50,065
now when I go to specify the style here
I'm gonna take advantage

263
00:17:50,065 --> 00:17:53,146
switched advance type imprints and that
lets me type

264
00:17:54,046 --> 00:17:58,117
just tight dot dark the compiler is
going on automatically in

265
00:17:59,017 --> 00:18:02,028
for the right enumeration type to use
here

266
00:18:02,028 --> 00:18:06,040
because it's obvious from the context
that save me having to type the full and

267
00:18:06,004 --> 00:18:07,010
numeration name

268
00:18:07,046 --> 00:18:10,645
it can really save a lot of typing okay

269
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:15,780
that should do a prior controller but
there's one last thing we need to set up

270
00:18:15,078 --> 00:18:19,090
remember that user session property that
I started off by creating

271
00:18:19,009 --> 00:18:23,107
we've never initialized anywhere said to
fix that let's take a very quick look at

272
00:18:24,088 --> 00:18:24,122
the

273
00:18:25,022 --> 00:18:28,055
other sites with development using yours
with classes

274
00:18:28,055 --> 00:18:33,058
inside objective-c the place that we
want to initialize this object

275
00:18:33,085 --> 00:18:36,177
is in the signing controllers prepare
for Segway met

276
00:18:37,077 --> 00:18:42,077
and if I go to signing controller United
this is an objective-c file

277
00:18:42,077 --> 00:18:45,133
and of course in objective-c before you
use your classes

278
00:18:46,033 --> 00:18:50,064
you need to import them but a class is
defined in sweats so

279
00:18:50,064 --> 00:18:53,163
how can we do that well when you're
using swept in a target

280
00:18:54,063 --> 00:18:57,102
Xcode what automatically generate a new
header for you

281
00:18:58,002 --> 00:19:01,010
that contains the declaration that each
have your sweat classes

282
00:19:01,082 --> 00:19:06,178
all that you need to do to use those
buses it import that header

283
00:19:07,078 --> 00:19:10,357
for this target no be called shutterbugs
dash wept

284
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:15,040
and I've added important now he also
noticed I'm taking advantage

285
00:19:15,004 --> 00:19:18,008
a the at imports and tax in objective-c

286
00:19:18,008 --> 00:19:22,039
because to to import my own core
shutterbugs primer

287
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:27,044
so does in place I can fill in the rest
to prepare for Segway

288
00:19:27,044 --> 00:19:32,115
I get the games view controller and all
set its user session property

289
00:19:33,015 --> 00:19:36,111
way you'll notice is that even though
gains table view controller

290
00:19:37,011 --> 00:19:40,025
is in Objective C Class that we to find
air

291
00:19:40,025 --> 00:19:44,096
site is a swift class that we just a
fine we can use it in objective-c

292
00:19:44,096 --> 00:19:47,177
just like any other class and we can
assign this property

293
00:19:48,077 --> 00:19:52,119
and if I came back to this code later
and I'd forgotten what the type was

294
00:19:53,019 --> 00:19:56,028
I can even use quick help to get the
view

295
00:19:56,028 --> 00:20:00,119
as objective-c would see it it even
includes the description on my property

296
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:04,025
even though I only ever wrote that one
place

297
00:20:04,025 --> 00:20:07,109
in mice with sore spot so it doesn't

298
00:20:08,009 --> 00:20:11,024
with those in place but see how it looks

299
00:20:11,024 --> 00:20:14,063
in a building run an Xcode will launch
our app

300
00:20:14,063 --> 00:20:19,069
in the iPhone by the simulator

301
00:20:19,069 --> 00:20:23,110
there's a great-looking sign on screen
if I click to play shutterbugs

302
00:20:24,001 --> 00:20:28,034
there you have it a new landing screen
completed Inc

303
00:20:28,043 --> 00:20:35,043
completed entirely in sweat and with
this great-looking by pretty effective

304
00:20:39,092 --> 00:20:42,127
we've integrated switch support
throughout Xcode 6

305
00:20:43,027 --> 00:20:46,074
so that you can use the same great
development features that your

306
00:20:46,074 --> 00:20:50,081
are you familiar with to immediately
start working with any language

307
00:20:51,044 --> 00:20:54,061
and with that I like to turn things over
to John Hess

308
00:20:54,061 --> 00:20:58,092
to talk to you about our brand new tools
for visual interface development

309
00:20:58,092 --> 00:21:04,158
thanks

310
00:21:05,058 --> 00:21:08,092
thanks Daniel I'd like to show all
appear how you can take advantage of the

311
00:21:08,092 --> 00:21:09,138
new features back said six

312
00:21:10,038 --> 00:21:13,717
the design the visual aspect the
application a tad over to the demo

313
00:21:14,059 --> 00:21:15,550
missing

314
00:21:15,055 --> 00:21:18,123
I have respect for my designer to
implement a circular ImageView

315
00:21:19,023 --> 00:21:22,030
it's gonna take us where images and by
crop into a circle

316
00:21:22,003 --> 00:21:25,003
and optionally be saturated color

317
00:21:25,003 --> 00:21:28,012
now I'm finding Xcode new playground
feature to be indispensable when working

318
00:21:29,002 --> 00:21:30,073
on be just like that

319
00:21:30,091 --> 00:21:33,107
I love giving being able to see the
result in my code

320
00:21:34,007 --> 00:21:39,014
side by side as I write my code I have a
playground set up just for this

321
00:21:39,077 --> 00:21:43,082
it start the sample image in europe a
basic function to manipulate a graphics

322
00:21:44,027 --> 00:21:47,030
contact and returning new image

323
00:21:47,003 --> 00:21:50,098
well paced innovative new code they will
take an animal

324
00:21:51,025 --> 00:21:54,114
an impediment optionally be saturated

325
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:58,018
and two-sample call to render my image

326
00:21:58,054 --> 00:22:01,141
here in the prime Wine I can see all the
result in my code

327
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:05,048
and by pressing this button I can bring
in a persistent preview

328
00:22:06,011 --> 00:22:10,830
any %uh values that are starting image

329
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:14,820
in here that you out but right now all
three look the same

330
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:17,126
because I haven't done anything the
process the image I'm just taking my

331
00:22:18,026 --> 00:22:19,054
source image

332
00:22:19,054 --> 00:22:22,060
and drawing a rock at the destination
okay

333
00:22:23,014 --> 00:22:27,035
the first step is the crop to a circle
America rated as a path

334
00:22:27,035 --> 00:22:30,114
for the noble and thrive in our square
at that the clipping path

335
00:22:31,014 --> 00:22:35,040
and now we have circular images things
look good

336
00:22:35,004 --> 00:22:38,103
I'd also like a desaturase my image I
mean it simply wash over it with the

337
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,208
white color

338
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:45,200
you the special court rafik 10 that
attract out the color and said adding

339
00:22:45,002 --> 00:22:46,049
white on top

340
00:22:46,067 --> 00:22:50,104
and I can see that our third call
produces a desaturated image

341
00:22:51,004 --> 00:22:56,027
things a great I'm ready to start using
this in my application

342
00:22:56,027 --> 00:23:02,054
gonna grab a copy this code

343
00:23:02,054 --> 00:23:05,096
and head over the mic what I've been
working on

344
00:23:05,096 --> 00:23:08,111
here's my prepare image function not
implemented yet

345
00:23:09,011 --> 00:23:12,066
so we're gonna pace than my coat on the
playground and I'm ready to start using

346
00:23:12,066 --> 00:23:13,161
that to my storyboard

347
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:18,087
all option click here open it in its
just that

348
00:23:18,087 --> 00:23:21,091
and down in the lower left corner you
see the square BO

349
00:23:21,091 --> 00:23:25,147
this is where I'd like my circular
ImageView to water to be

350
00:23:26,047 --> 00:23:29,119
and interpersonal there's an inspector I
can people still in its essence

351
00:23:30,019 --> 00:23:33,023
regular you I be on

352
00:23:33,023 --> 00:23:39,050
of high Interface Builder auto we you'll
see it build in the module name as well

353
00:23:39,005 --> 00:23:42,184
my circular ImageView by with the
finding a framework

354
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:45,742
while my story boards in the main
application so the model name in the pot

355
00:23:46,309 --> 00:23:51,720
name together complete the reference my
class

356
00:23:51,072 --> 00:23:54,123
now still awaits where here at this
point

357
00:23:55,023 --> 00:23:58,044
Interface Builder is doing what it
always make a beloved doing

358
00:23:58,044 --> 00:24:02,050
it saying this you a view will be a
sensible circular ImageView

359
00:24:02,005 --> 00:24:06,564
hour runtime a record six we can make
any sense and the circular ImageView

360
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:10,910
at design time as well let me show you
how to do that

361
00:24:10,091 --> 00:24:14,105
we've added a couple new source after
beard you can add your classes

362
00:24:15,005 --> 00:24:19,099
the first is I be desirable goes right
here at the copier class

363
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:22,103
goes in the same place for objective-c
spelled a little bit differently

364
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:27,096
but has the exact same result
interpersonal was able to pay per class

365
00:24:27,096 --> 00:24:30,122
build our framework instantiated and
render

366
00:24:31,022 --> 00:24:34,048
live in the campus you can see here

367
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:40,085
now you may be wondering wears hats lol
coming from

368
00:24:40,085 --> 00:24:43,130
down here my source file I have
overwritten the new method prepare for

369
00:24:44,003 --> 00:24:45,042
InterBase dollar

370
00:24:45,069 --> 00:24:49,075
this is going to be invoked honor view
right before renders into the campus

371
00:24:49,075 --> 00:24:52,107
and at the last minute chance for us to
do any additional setup

372
00:24:53,007 --> 00:24:58,039
here I'm simply making sure that we
always have an image repair

373
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:01,041
now I like just configure my image

374
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:05,098
directly there based on their an offer I
saturation as well

375
00:25:05,098 --> 00:25:08,104
no problem we have two new store another
news or Saturday a

376
00:25:09,058 --> 00:25:12,134
I the inspector Paul I can put it here
in front of my property

377
00:25:13,034 --> 00:25:16,983
and when I returned Interface Builder

378
00:25:17,289 --> 00:25:22,480
I can see an inspector they have two new
bo2 directly drive these values

379
00:25:22,048 --> 00:25:25,377
but pick another image alright

380
00:25:25,809 --> 00:25:28,820
that looks great but when user comes
here

381
00:25:28,082 --> 00:25:31,113
I can refocus on this photograph

382
00:25:32,013 --> 00:25:35,282
not distracted by the bright colors in
this player image

383
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:39,580
that are saturating comes into play but
it comes down to bed

384
00:25:39,058 --> 00:25:44,037
can see the campus is upping highway and
things were good

385
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,630
makes her look at another image ho Yanks

386
00:25:48,269 --> 00:25:51,322
she gets wet and

387
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:54,700
not sure what's going on here but I
suspect it probably has something to do

388
00:25:54,007 --> 00:25:57,048
with my prepare image much and I just
wrote

389
00:25:58,011 --> 00:26:02,012
gonna go ahead and put a breakpoint
there

390
00:26:02,021 --> 00:26:05,830
and with my view selected I can't use

391
00:26:06,019 --> 00:26:10,340
the bugs like the beers interprets voice
and a cake topper request to render this

392
00:26:10,034 --> 00:26:11,060
view why the campus

393
00:26:11,006 --> 00:26:18,006
so that I can see just what's going on

394
00:26:20,006 --> 00:26:22,075
now not sure the problem is here

395
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:26,077
but stepping into the code now actually
I can see right away

396
00:26:26,077 --> 00:26:29,082
bring up a quick help a quick work on
this rectangle

397
00:26:30,027 --> 00:26:33,053
I can see it really is a rectangle it's
much wider than it is call

398
00:26:33,053 --> 00:26:36,072
and Interface Builder taking a
rectangular image my view is

399
00:26:36,072 --> 00:26:39,138
in squishing it down and that's where
we're getting this product image

400
00:26:40,038 --> 00:26:43,069
I think what I want instead is to
produce

401
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:47,071
a square image and draw the source image
centered in the destination

402
00:26:47,071 --> 00:26:52,073
interface dollars in automatically pick
up my changes

403
00:26:52,073 --> 00:26:55,164
rear-ended a campus and I can see we're
in business things were great

404
00:26:56,064 --> 00:27:00,723
alright I'm done with the scene

405
00:27:01,299 --> 00:27:05,110
mine accidents that happen this is
typically

406
00:27:05,011 --> 00:27:09,059
the head over to my iPad storyboard and
make much the same sad about it

407
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:14,152
because without had arrived at
storyboard

408
00:27:15,052 --> 00:27:19,053
and I can see that I have a lot of work
to do. I haven't even started on the

409
00:27:19,062 --> 00:27:19,124
scene yet

410
00:27:20,024 --> 00:27:23,107
no problem Xcode 6 all this for us as
well

411
00:27:24,007 --> 00:27:28,041
we have a new feature universal story
boards that allow it to build a single

412
00:27:28,041 --> 00:27:31,810
storyboard target both the iPad and
iPhone

413
00:27:32,179 --> 00:27:35,410
gonna head back over to my iPhone
storyboard thank you

414
00:27:35,041 --> 00:27:41,047
and i wanna show you just how easy it is
to get started with universal story

415
00:27:41,047 --> 00:27:41,095
boards

416
00:27:41,095 --> 00:27:45,147
and the file inspector

417
00:27:46,047 --> 00:27:49,756
there's a new checkbox used by squatters
I'm gonna go ahead and label them

418
00:27:50,179 --> 00:27:54,100
size factors are foundational new
technology reform

419
00:27:54,001 --> 00:27:57,050
underpinnings the new adaptive user
interfaces and I was a

420
00:27:57,059 --> 00:28:00,096
what size boxes I can customize

421
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:06,112
which using constraints participate any
to my way out adopting size matters

422
00:28:07,012 --> 00:28:11,014
also upgrade all the same way to my
storyboard to the new adaptive

423
00:28:11,032 --> 00:28:12,761
counterparts from ISA

424
00:28:13,049 --> 00:28:16,640
segways the for example no to present a
popover on iPad

425
00:28:16,064 --> 00:28:19,095
in a moral condition on the iPhone now

426
00:28:19,095 --> 00:28:24,064
you can see Interface Builder is
rendering my campus here as square

427
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:27,983
this is an abstract representation its
met her mind you

428
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:32,510
you're not heading for specific device
you're editing for all devices

429
00:28:32,051 --> 00:28:35,082
if I wanna see how things look on
specific device

430
00:28:35,082 --> 00:28:39,071
I can open enhance preview editor an
Ecotec

431
00:28:39,809 --> 00:28:43,440
here you can see there are allowed as a
great job

432
00:28:43,044 --> 00:28:46,090
a trampoline my interface the screen
have a porn site on

433
00:28:46,009 --> 00:28:51,046
I can zoom out and I can add more

434
00:28:52,027 --> 00:28:55,060
screens as well here's some interface
will be presented

435
00:28:55,006 --> 00:28:58,080
on an iPad in portrait and

436
00:28:59,034 --> 00:29:02,122
you can see as well the auto layout has
translated my eyes train all the way up

437
00:29:03,022 --> 00:29:06,036
but I have a custom layout just for iPad

438
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:09,120
Karachi that would Peter well

439
00:29:10,002 --> 00:29:13,061
but it started the first-order
businesses that is part of our

440
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:17,147
should be short behind shorten it up and
how Interface Builder

441
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:21,082
up at the conference Obama constraints
from the brain to campus

442
00:29:21,082 --> 00:29:24,150
and wall you can see they both got sore

443
00:29:25,005 --> 00:29:28,082
well I'm editing both interfaces they
want to do universal storyboard

444
00:29:29,027 --> 00:29:32,121
how do I edit just wanted them me on do
this change

445
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:38,065
down here in the bottom center at the
campus is a new control

446
00:29:38,065 --> 00:29:42,122
for picking which side last year adding
then right now we're reading this I spot

447
00:29:43,022 --> 00:29:44,030
for anywhere

448
00:29:44,003 --> 00:29:48,028
at any high the basis for all them all
layouts and Karen s

449
00:29:48,055 --> 00:29:51,089
as represented as this choice here in
the center

450
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:55,103
as I move away from the banner things
get more specific

451
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:59,132
down here in the bottom right corner

452
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:02,224
is the regular where regular height
layout it's the largest

453
00:30:02,809 --> 00:30:06,810
and it's the basis of my iPad layout I'm
going to use it

454
00:30:06,909 --> 00:30:10,280
and Interface Builder enlarges the
campus to remind me that I'm working

455
00:30:10,028 --> 00:30:15,102
in a specific size box now but go ahead
make the parts order again

456
00:30:16,002 --> 00:30:19,023
and update the contents

457
00:30:19,023 --> 00:30:23,026
and now you can see that the iPad

458
00:30:23,053 --> 00:30:26,087
has changed while I thought has remained
just wait I designed it

459
00:30:26,087 --> 00:30:29,276
down here in the bottom left at the
scene

460
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:33,700
I have a completely new way out in mind
rather than as editing the constraint

461
00:30:33,007 --> 00:30:33,606
conference

462
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:39,325
I want new constraints no problem off
select all previous years

463
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:42,750
and have been a bit over clear the
constraints

464
00:30:42,075 --> 00:30:45,734
in only the size class and reposition

465
00:30:46,409 --> 00:30:53,409
I'm gonna have the image front and
center

466
00:30:56,048 --> 00:30:59,125
read about their me a little our and

467
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:04,034
I signs the same issue arbitrarily I
need to pay and its size

468
00:31:04,034 --> 00:31:09,087
all start with an explosive with
constraint and now

469
00:31:09,087 --> 00:31:12,121
I said that the with should be you know
some complimentary happened to be

470
00:31:13,021 --> 00:31:17,050
120 points I want too high to be the
same around and duplicating the constant

471
00:31:17,005 --> 00:31:18,012
you since last year

472
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:26,002
I can add an aspect ratio constraint
saying the weapon height should be equal

473
00:31:43,054 --> 00:31:47,058
her

474
00:31:47,094 --> 00:31:48,139
I could continue those at

475
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:52,088
position abuse underneath and have been
a faithful gather many constraints

476
00:31:52,088 --> 00:31:55,169
to produce an iPad layout there was
unique that I've had her face while

477
00:31:56,069 --> 00:31:57,128
maintaining my iPhone buyout

478
00:31:58,028 --> 00:32:01,297
just the way that it was now they can
turn it over

479
00:32:01,549 --> 00:32:08,549
take can ordinary what's new with the
biking and xxx

480
00:32:13,081 --> 00:32:14,084
alright thanks John

481
00:32:15,011 --> 00:32:18,066
morning so I just taken over the

482
00:32:18,066 --> 00:32:21,101
for details screen from another engineer
on our set a box team

483
00:32:22,001 --> 00:32:25,075
love to give you a sneak peek at you I
now okay

484
00:32:25,075 --> 00:32:32,075
so the first thing I'm gonna do with
them in Iran and then we will sign into

485
00:32:34,059 --> 00:32:34,151
the game

486
00:32:35,051 --> 00:32:38,062
on navigators in progress game

487
00:32:38,062 --> 00:32:42,090
and I'm gonna click on this particular
picture and then here we are at the

488
00:32:42,009 --> 00:32:43,041
photo details

489
00:32:44,022 --> 00:32:47,034
you I'm so what we're seeing in this
case a

490
00:32:47,034 --> 00:32:51,116
is a picture that paula talk we see a
list of all the other players in the

491
00:32:52,016 --> 00:32:52,069
game

492
00:32:52,069 --> 00:32:55,097
along with comments they made on this
particular photo

493
00:32:55,097 --> 00:33:01,105
and whether they like it or not you know
is I looked at this you I hear

494
00:33:02,077 --> 00:33:06,089
I'm a little bit skeptical that all
these players

495
00:33:06,089 --> 00:33:10,096
are missing their picture so they're
also in this kinda placeholder image and

496
00:33:10,096 --> 00:33:12,113
that not something I'm expecting to see
here

497
00:33:13,013 --> 00:33:16,097
so let's go ahead and let's dig into
that now

498
00:33:16,097 --> 00:33:19,162
I'm relatively new to this Kobe but

499
00:33:20,062 --> 00:33:23,149
I do know that our problem here it's
going to be a want to place

500
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:27,144
so do you are going to be on the model
side things either the that maybe the

501
00:33:28,044 --> 00:33:29,081
image there just isn't there

502
00:33:29,081 --> 00:33:32,090
or it's going to be around the you I
thought it thanks we have the image data

503
00:33:33,071 --> 00:33:34,126
but we're not pushing it to the screen

504
00:33:35,026 --> 00:33:38,065
so we want we want to figure out exactly
where a problem

505
00:33:38,065 --> 00:33:43,098
so the the first they need to do here to
figure out what you controller is

506
00:33:43,098 --> 00:33:44,142
responsible for

507
00:33:45,042 --> 00:33:48,077
this you here and I think

508
00:33:48,077 --> 00:33:51,083
is this guy photo detailed new
controller

509
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:54,147
so what I want to do is I want to set a
breakpoint I in this

510
00:33:55,047 --> 00:33:59,088
you did appear and then let's try to
trigger that and see if

511
00:33:59,088 --> 00:34:02,120
if we are in the right place when I get
away

512
00:34:03,002 --> 00:34:06,028
welcome back and

513
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:09,114
there we okay if the breakpoint good so
probably in the right place

514
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:14,023
but I'd like to be really sure that were
in the right place

515
00:34:14,023 --> 00:34:17,058
and I'm gonna do that by using the brand
new

516
00:34:17,058 --> 00:34:22,087
quick look for you I D you an exco so
now I can just mouse over this view here

517
00:34:22,087 --> 00:34:23,087
to get the data tape

518
00:34:23,087 --> 00:34:26,138
which is the view on by the view
controller and I can click on our little

519
00:34:27,038 --> 00:34:27,119
pocket button

520
00:34:28,019 --> 00:34:35,019
and just like that I can see a rendering
I can see a rendering a this viewer any

521
00:34:38,089 --> 00:34:39,135
some placid you I view

522
00:34:40,035 --> 00:34:43,064
rain your next call on stepping through
my code and a course if you're

523
00:34:43,064 --> 00:34:44,343
developing a Mac App

524
00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:48,360
this works great for an issue 2 are

525
00:34:48,036 --> 00:34:51,081
so now step one complete we know we're
in the right place

526
00:34:51,081 --> 00:34:55,087
good but we care about is the model

527
00:34:56,041 --> 00:35:00,053
the model optics and I think our model
objects

528
00:35:00,053 --> 00:35:05,085
are these game comments looks like we
have a game comment for every row of

529
00:35:05,085 --> 00:35:05,093
data here

530
00:35:06,065 --> 00:35:10,080
so these rows are backed by a game
comment now

531
00:35:10,008 --> 00:35:14,065
when I'm debugging I really love to use

532
00:35:15,037 --> 00:35:19,038
quick look I'm a really big hole guy
quick look is a really great way

533
00:35:19,047 --> 00:35:22,088
to visualize my object when I'm stepping
through my co

534
00:35:22,088 --> 00:35:25,120
wouldn't it be great if we could have

535
00:35:26,002 --> 00:35:29,077
custom quickly representations for our
own classes

536
00:35:29,095 --> 00:35:32,102
one fact now inside an expert you can do
just that

537
00:35:33,065 --> 00:35:36,117
we've gone through our project and done
it all throughout our classes

538
00:35:37,017 --> 00:35:40,068
let's see if we have one for this game
comment there were investigating

539
00:35:40,068 --> 00:35:45,076
and sure enough we do and what we'll see

540
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:48,084
is that somebody's implemented this new
the ball

541
00:35:48,084 --> 00:35:51,163
quick look object method so this is a
method that you can implement in your

542
00:35:52,063 --> 00:35:56,147
own classes and it's a matter that
external call when you initiate a quick

543
00:35:57,047 --> 00:35:57,090
look

544
00:35:57,009 --> 00:36:00,032
from the water now

545
00:36:01,013 --> 00:36:04,088
from this method you can return anything
that has a built-in quick look inside

546
00:36:04,088 --> 00:36:04,167
expert so

547
00:36:05,067 --> 00:36:10,073
maybe a an image or a busy past or a
string

548
00:36:11,027 --> 00:36:14,030
for this case in attributed string

549
00:36:14,003 --> 00:36:17,056
which is gonna let us have a little bit
more complex visualization so we're

550
00:36:17,083 --> 00:36:17,162
gonna be able to take

551
00:36:18,062 --> 00:36:21,069
text and image and put those together in
a nice

552
00:36:22,032 --> 00:36:26,114
a nice visualization cover model of now
I'm really curious how was he with the

553
00:36:27,014 --> 00:36:28,020
section looks like

554
00:36:28,002 --> 00:36:31,014
so let's go back to where we're paused

555
00:36:31,032 --> 00:36:34,034
and I'm a mouse over our game comments
array

556
00:36:34,034 --> 00:36:37,127
I can see there's 3 upon which matches
what I see on the screen that's good

557
00:36:38,027 --> 00:36:41,030
and then a I'm just gonna press quick
what button

558
00:36:41,003 --> 00:36:48,003
bone just like that I'm seeing my model
object exactly the way I wanna

559
00:36:51,001 --> 00:36:54,007
intercourse with a narrow down through
the and great

560
00:36:54,007 --> 00:36:57,016
so now we know we've eliminated the
model as being our

561
00:36:58,006 --> 00:37:01,032
source in our problem here we can see
the player images right here

562
00:37:01,086 --> 00:37:04,092
so we know it's not a model side issue

563
00:37:04,092 --> 00:37:09,124
so let's get ready this breakpoint in
let's continue onward

564
00:37:10,024 --> 00:37:14,046
okay so to the issue must be up here in
the UI

565
00:37:14,046 --> 00:37:17,068
and you know whatever review is
responsible for

566
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:22,071
for drying this BTU I isn't doing its
job

567
00:37:22,098 --> 00:37:27,122
now like I said I'm i'm new to this code
base I'm not really sure what views are

568
00:37:28,022 --> 00:37:29,048
responsible

569
00:37:29,048 --> 00:37:32,136
for pushing these particular pixels to
the screen

570
00:37:33,036 --> 00:37:36,037
how are we gonna deal with that how are
we gonna

571
00:37:36,037 --> 00:37:39,049
are willing to buck this issue

572
00:37:39,049 --> 00:37:43,055
well Xcode 6 introduces a brand new way

573
00:37:43,055 --> 00:37:47,117
to visualize your app when you're the
bug so you can press this new to bug you

574
00:37:48,017 --> 00:37:50,026
are given right here

575
00:37:50,026 --> 00:37:53,105
in Xcode will poll in a representation
you're tired you are

576
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:57,014
hierarchy right inside mexico where you
can see things like

577
00:37:57,095 --> 00:38:00,166
snapshots of all your views their frames

578
00:38:01,066 --> 00:38:03,075
and all sorts of other interesting
properties that when you combine them

579
00:38:04,056 --> 00:38:04,144
together

580
00:38:05,044 --> 00:38:09,062
they help to give you a really great
understanding why your app

581
00:38:09,062 --> 00:38:12,126
looks the way it does or maybe more
importantly why it doesn't

582
00:38:13,026 --> 00:38:17,073
quite match expectations so I can for
example let's cook on this

583
00:38:17,073 --> 00:38:21,126
this label here and open the inspector

584
00:38:22,026 --> 00:38:25,030
and I can see that this is a UI label

585
00:38:25,066 --> 00:38:28,071
I can see it's tax I can see is fought

586
00:38:28,071 --> 00:38:32,077
I can see its fontcolor all the things
that I'm used to seeing when I'm

587
00:38:33,031 --> 00:38:35,077
designing my UI and I B

588
00:38:35,077 --> 00:38:38,138
well I can see those right now wanna be
bugging it as well

589
00:38:39,038 --> 00:38:43,134
really really powerful so what we care
about though is this

590
00:38:44,034 --> 00:38:48,068
this'll picture right here so it's like
that guy

591
00:38:48,068 --> 00:38:51,084
and what I'm interested in seeing is
what

592
00:38:51,084 --> 00:38:55,086
cell owns a picture so what sells
probably doing the wiring up a

593
00:38:55,086 --> 00:38:59,129
the model data to the UI controls now I
can use

594
00:39:00,029 --> 00:39:04,093
Xcode jump or to see the entire view our
key the selected

595
00:39:04,093 --> 00:39:07,175
object and somebody go up here and Missy

596
00:39:08,075 --> 00:39:12,167
that that view is in this game comment

597
00:39:13,067 --> 00:39:17,165
table view cell so let's find out over
here in the navigator

598
00:39:18,065 --> 00:39:21,099
and it's this guy okay

599
00:39:21,099 --> 00:39:24,196
looks like a very clean a very simple

600
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:29,143
class it has this use game comment

601
00:39:30,043 --> 00:39:35,075
method which takes the model data and
then it looks like it wires it up

602
00:39:35,075 --> 00:39:38,136
to the UI controls so what I see here is
a see that

603
00:39:39,036 --> 00:39:43,040
the player's name is pushed into this
player label

604
00:39:43,076 --> 00:39:47,091
I see that the comment is pushed into
the comment label

605
00:39:47,091 --> 00:39:51,115
what I don't say as I don't see us
taking that player image in pushing that

606
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:55,077
into anything so that's probably our
problem here

607
00:39:55,077 --> 00:39:59,140
and it was me it was really easy to find
that using X cuz new Peter Parker

608
00:40:00,004 --> 00:40:03,092
so I'll go ahead and fix that later and
that is probably gonna take care on this

609
00:40:04,028 --> 00:40:08,112
this missing image that we're seeing but
you know

610
00:40:09,012 --> 00:40:13,099
as I look at the UI here it doesn't
quite match

611
00:40:13,099 --> 00:40:16,148
doesn't quite match the design that I
was looking at earlier with my designer

612
00:40:17,048 --> 00:40:20,143
so this post actually be a little button
right around here in the bottom left to

613
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:22,122
the picture

614
00:40:23,022 --> 00:40:26,093
that lets me like this image from first
to come to this you I'd say

615
00:40:26,093 --> 00:40:31,109
I like polish picture right now i i
can't do that

616
00:40:32,009 --> 00:40:36,036
now the question then is where is there
but

617
00:40:36,036 --> 00:40:40,094
well mainland but was never added to the
view hierarchy

618
00:40:40,094 --> 00:40:44,172
may be trying out of screen somewhere
maybe it's the wrong size

619
00:40:45,072 --> 00:40:49,072
maybe it's album component is wrong
maybe hiding behind another view

620
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:52,094
is also to really visual kinda problems

621
00:40:52,094 --> 00:40:55,102
that we could have was control and
they're all made really easy to track

622
00:40:56,074 --> 00:40:56,139
down

623
00:40:57,039 --> 00:41:01,125
with the new YouTube are so let's go
back let's go back over your Xcode

624
00:41:02,025 --> 00:41:05,044
and lets look at our view hierarchy
answer what I want to do now there is

625
00:41:05,044 --> 00:41:07,133
one explore this view our can look
through and see

626
00:41:08,033 --> 00:41:11,039
if if that money is in fact here

627
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:15,056
so the first thing i'll do is i'll just
sorta twist this guy sideways

628
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:18,068
I wanna people hide summaries & reviews

629
00:41:18,068 --> 00:41:23,086
sure

630
00:41:23,086 --> 00:41:27,104
and then I wanna I wanna whole the use a
par

631
00:41:28,004 --> 00:41:32,039
so let's do that and hey

632
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:35,110
feel little something peeking out right
back here

633
00:41:36,001 --> 00:41:39,002
that could be a button but this still
some stuff in the way

634
00:41:39,011 --> 00:41:42,090
sewn to peel back some interviews in the
front so I can just hide things from the

635
00:41:42,009 --> 00:41:44,041
front backwards

636
00:41:45,022 --> 00:41:51,109
yeah very nice

637
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:55,051
and sure enough are button is hanging
out right here

638
00:41:55,051 --> 00:42:00,078
so but select that and the next question
I'm asking myself is and why is our

639
00:42:00,078 --> 00:42:00,151
button

640
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:05,076
down here and i no reason auto layout in
this project

641
00:42:05,076 --> 00:42:08,141
so I wanna I'd like to look at the
constraints that reason here so I can

642
00:42:09,041 --> 00:42:10,086
show the constraints

643
00:42:10,086 --> 00:42:13,151
for this particular view and just like
that

644
00:42:14,051 --> 00:42:17,078
Xcode hides all the other views that are
relevant

645
00:42:17,078 --> 00:42:24,078
inches me just the constraints with this
particular control

646
00:42:28,001 --> 00:42:32,002
and we can really easily see that the
button is pinned to the bottom

647
00:42:32,002 --> 00:42:36,024
left which is not where we want it we
want a pin to the bottom

648
00:42:36,024 --> 00:42:40,092
on the picture about so that's something
that might be really hard to track down

649
00:42:40,092 --> 00:42:42,124
before but is really easy

650
00:42:43,024 --> 00:42:46,069
to track down now

651
00:42:46,069 --> 00:42:50,088
okay so with Xcode 6

652
00:42:50,088 --> 00:42:53,173
as we've seen the you have the ability
to visualize your apt when you're

653
00:42:54,073 --> 00:42:55,088
debugging

654
00:42:55,088 --> 00:42:59,093
like never before you can create custom
quick look representations

655
00:43:00,038 --> 00:43:03,050
love your own classes that show your
data

656
00:43:03,005 --> 00:43:06,005
exactly the way you wanna see a

657
00:43:06,005 --> 00:43:11,020
and you bugging well that adds an entire
new dimension to the way you can explore

658
00:43:11,065 --> 00:43:14,154
interact with your app runtime: really
really powerful

659
00:43:15,054 --> 00:43:18,054
and a unified really insightful as well

660
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:21,083
and with that like to turn it over to
Kate's tone to talk a little bit more

661
00:43:21,083 --> 00:43:22,169
about how we can enhance performance

662
00:43:23,069 --> 00:43:30,069
cover-up kinda

663
00:43:30,072 --> 00:43:33,094
thank you can it looks like we have a
spectacular game coming together

664
00:43:33,094 --> 00:43:35,183
we think our users are going to be
really happy with a lot of these new

665
00:43:36,083 --> 00:43:36,090
features

666
00:43:37,053 --> 00:43:41,084
if we can just make sure that we should
quality product of course that a lot of

667
00:43:41,084 --> 00:43:41,130
pics

668
00:43:42,003 --> 00:43:45,018
the development process is to make sure
that what we're about to send out into

669
00:43:45,045 --> 00:43:45,051
the world

670
00:43:46,005 --> 00:43:50,061
is going to live up to expectations my
team is done the right thing every step

671
00:43:50,061 --> 00:43:50,117
of the way

672
00:43:51,017 --> 00:43:54,025
we've tried to make sure that what we
have is a product

673
00:43:54,025 --> 00:43:57,093
that high quality because the course
we've got a set a unit test

674
00:43:57,093 --> 00:44:00,114
running so I got

675
00:44:01,014 --> 00:44:04,015
the product up and running I can go to
my test navigator

676
00:44:04,015 --> 00:44:07,076
and the test navigator shows that I have
several

677
00:44:07,076 --> 00:44:10,167
32 the anatase here so I can go ahead
and run knows one last time

678
00:44:11,067 --> 00:44:14,139
make sure that when the game comes up we
put it through its paces per green

679
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:15,132
across the board

680
00:44:16,032 --> 00:44:20,083
looks good from a functional perspective
the game is doing exactly what we expect

681
00:44:20,083 --> 00:44:23,092
and that's great because I got one last
change I want to make to the game

682
00:44:24,073 --> 00:44:27,077
I was thinking about and tinkering with
me filters to give

683
00:44:28,013 --> 00:44:32,015
a little bit more life to our images
specifically here are taking advantage

684
00:44:32,015 --> 00:44:35,051
swept feature let me build an extension
the UI

685
00:44:35,051 --> 00:44:38,060
image quite so I can take an existing
+class

686
00:44:38,006 --> 00:44:42,017
and add the ability to apply filters to
it so I have a variety of filters here

687
00:44:42,071 --> 00:44:45,103
the vignette filters when I was thinking
about trying where

688
00:44:46,003 --> 00:44:49,068
so maybe I should go ahead and build one
more test but this time

689
00:44:49,068 --> 00:44:52,139
a performance test to make sure it's
going to live up to my expectations

690
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:56,076
34 heidi was going to ask for one

691
00:44:56,076 --> 00:45:03,076
mean file pick a test case class you're
probably already familiar with I'm going

692
00:45:04,005 --> 00:45:05,008
to go ahead and use with

693
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:08,077
for that and you'll note that of course
like all templates I have that choice

694
00:45:08,077 --> 00:45:09,108
swifter objective-c

695
00:45:10,008 --> 00:45:13,056
the tax code knows that I've been using
Swiss throughout the conference so with

696
00:45:13,056 --> 00:45:13,120
the default

697
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:17,021
for me want to call this for to

698
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:20,087
put in my existing group with my to

699
00:45:20,087 --> 00:45:23,142
and a country that far from

700
00:45:24,042 --> 00:45:28,051
so now I have what should be fairly
familiar it's got the usual set up

701
00:45:28,051 --> 00:45:32,092
and tear down method written into a it's
got a functional tapped

702
00:45:32,092 --> 00:45:35,113
we're not focused on me those today want
to set those aside

703
00:45:36,013 --> 00:45:39,018
and focus on the one new method that's
been put in place

704
00:45:39,018 --> 00:45:43,052
the ability to test for performing so
I'm going to

705
00:45:43,052 --> 00:45:47,063
test filter performance here and all I
need to do

706
00:45:47,063 --> 00:45:52,065
is fill in this measure block call now
you saw the objective-c cent tax on a

707
00:45:52,065 --> 00:45:52,163
slide earlier

708
00:45:53,063 --> 00:45:56,066
the swift intact is really clean

709
00:45:56,066 --> 00:46:00,068
it's just call to measure walk that
passes one trillion closure

710
00:46:00,086 --> 00:46:03,088
that does the actual work and so in this
case

711
00:46:03,088 --> 00:46:06,112
for my work I'm going to go ahead and
fill in

712
00:46:07,012 --> 00:46:10,018
a testament to pick up when the player
images and then go ahead and apply

713
00:46:10,072 --> 00:46:11,105
internet filter to

714
00:46:12,005 --> 00:46:15,017
but the vineyard filters not part of my

715
00:46:15,017 --> 00:46:18,101
test project so again we're getting a
live issue here reminding me

716
00:46:19,001 --> 00:46:22,100
but I don't have access to that class
directly so all I need to do in

717
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,006
is important the shutterbug module

718
00:46:27,006 --> 00:46:30,034
and I've everything I need excites the
taft

719
00:46:30,034 --> 00:46:34,045
indexing is found the taft I'm one click
away from building my project

720
00:46:34,045 --> 00:46:38,089
and running that tough and seeing just
how long this takes it's going to run

721
00:46:38,089 --> 00:46:41,116
number of times to get figure out how
long it takes whether there's any

722
00:46:42,016 --> 00:46:42,091
variation

723
00:46:42,091 --> 00:46:45,173
and when it's done it will come exactly
how long it took to run and what kind of

724
00:46:46,073 --> 00:46:47,112
standard deviation I'm seeing

725
00:46:48,012 --> 00:46:51,080
4 percent in this case some getting
pretty consistent run to run

726
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:54,076
time summit sounds good but

727
00:46:55,048 --> 00:46:59,062
taking a little longer than I wanted it
to so what I'd really like to do

728
00:46:59,062 --> 00:47:02,103
is twist this open and see that I
haven't set a baseline haven't set a

729
00:47:03,003 --> 00:47:03,069
target

730
00:47:03,069 --> 00:47:06,153
from my timing and i really wanna the
target I wanted something that was

731
00:47:07,053 --> 00:47:10,137
snappy to live up to our users
expectations so I can go to establish a

732
00:47:11,037 --> 00:47:11,044
baseline

733
00:47:12,007 --> 00:47:15,035
either based on what I have now for I
can go in

734
00:47:15,035 --> 00:47:19,113
at a patent say 0.25 seconds is more
what I had in mind here

735
00:47:20,013 --> 00:47:23,079
and now I'll get a reminder every time I
run this tapped

736
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:27,127
but I'm not living up to expectations
this test is going to fail

737
00:47:28,027 --> 00:47:33,072
rad because it wasn't after we could
take time to tinker with that but I

738
00:47:33,072 --> 00:47:33,160
don't apply

739
00:47:34,006 --> 00:47:37,100
a number of different filters as
extensions to you I am in shares for me

740
00:47:38,054 --> 00:47:39,151
just go back and choose another one of
these

741
00:47:40,051 --> 00:47:45,059
appointees for nor filter we bill

742
00:47:45,059 --> 00:47:48,088
retest and make sure that that many
expectations

743
00:47:48,088 --> 00:47:51,126
looks good for all grain so across the
board

744
00:47:52,026 --> 00:47:56,035
were in great shape to ship this product
what about had a problem that I wasn't

745
00:47:56,035 --> 00:47:57,090
able to take care of here

746
00:47:57,009 --> 00:48:00,077
what if I had a performance issue I
needed to investigate well of course

747
00:48:01,058 --> 00:48:04,061
instrument to be answered of such
questions

748
00:48:04,061 --> 00:48:07,082
instrument is a great way to get more
detail about what's going on in your

749
00:48:07,082 --> 00:48:07,151
project

750
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:11,074
cell I'm scooping up the context menu
for this cast

751
00:48:11,074 --> 00:48:17,160
and choose to profile that particular
filter exercise behind the scenes were

752
00:48:18,006 --> 00:48:20,052
gonna go ahead and built specifically
for profiling

753
00:48:21,006 --> 00:48:26,060
and launch instrument and now we get our
first glimpse up in new instrument fewer

754
00:48:26,006 --> 00:48:29,020
instrument has been overhauled
dramatically this release both

755
00:48:29,074 --> 00:48:32,089
to be consistent with the new OS 10
yosemite

756
00:48:32,089 --> 00:48:35,093
but also so that it's more familiar for
people who are comfortable with Xcode

757
00:48:36,029 --> 00:48:37,064
already

758
00:48:37,064 --> 00:48:41,100
we start of with the temperature here I
can see at a glance

759
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,061
want to buy from targeting 1 I'm
planning on running

760
00:48:45,061 --> 00:48:48,138
can find the right template to exercise
what I'm looking for I'm just gonna look

761
00:48:49,038 --> 00:48:51,040
at memory in this case

762
00:48:51,004 --> 00:48:56,026
I can look at what I've been using
recently for pick from the completely

763
00:48:56,062 --> 00:48:59,073
watches that template I'm going to
insurance proper

764
00:48:59,073 --> 00:49:02,074
I mean sure its main window is also
dramatically overhaul

765
00:49:02,083 --> 00:49:06,097
the fee a few things at a glance one is
that it's not immediately recording

766
00:49:06,097 --> 00:49:09,145
how many times have you chosen a
template founded it starts recording

767
00:49:10,045 --> 00:49:11,087
immediately stop it

768
00:49:11,087 --> 00:49:14,106
go back and tinker with the settings now
we give you an option to go in and

769
00:49:15,006 --> 00:49:17,061
change the settings before you record

770
00:49:17,061 --> 00:49:20,079
or to go straight to record

771
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:23,113
so I'd like to do with be able to browse
through make sure that got the settings

772
00:49:24,013 --> 00:49:24,089
I want

773
00:49:24,089 --> 00:49:27,111
any fear that the settings are now of
centralized in the inspector

774
00:49:28,011 --> 00:49:32,052
again for familiarity for Xcode users so
I can make sure that my allocations to

775
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:33,056
intercept the way I want

776
00:49:33,092 --> 00:49:36,119
my VM tracker set up the way I want and
when it's all good

777
00:49:37,019 --> 00:49:40,072
I go to New overhauled toolbar weaker

778
00:49:40,072 --> 00:49:45,073
cleaner and taking a blessed screen real
estate than ever to start recording

779
00:49:45,073 --> 00:49:48,116
and we start recording and as always
allocations is tracking

780
00:49:49,016 --> 00:49:53,032
everything that's going on forgetting
are a recording about Amalek regions

781
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:57,101
all the objective see objects everything
we could possibly want

782
00:49:58,001 --> 00:50:01,006
we can go and look at that a little bit
more detail perhaps we'd like to filter

783
00:50:01,051 --> 00:50:02,051
down to a subset

784
00:50:02,051 --> 00:50:06,060
this while filtering is now just a
simple quick contract no modifier keys

785
00:50:06,006 --> 00:50:12,031
made

786
00:50:12,085 --> 00:50:15,109
so I can see all kind to detail about
all kinds of objects

787
00:50:16,009 --> 00:50:19,100
by Camaro and on something like my first
task of

788
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,018
I know that was allocated and of course
swept object

789
00:50:23,018 --> 00:50:26,082
are represented alongside everything
else here we can see the module name

790
00:50:26,082 --> 00:50:31,097
as well the classroom and get detail so
I can say for this particular class

791
00:50:31,097 --> 00:50:35,135
what inferences were allocated and when
that inference was allocated

792
00:50:36,035 --> 00:50:40,102
what stack trace Senate it came from so
it on a detail right at your fingertips

793
00:50:41,002 --> 00:50:44,008
and of course that carries over as well
that if I want to look not just

794
00:50:44,062 --> 00:50:48,069
individual object but overall statistics
where objects coming from

795
00:50:49,032 --> 00:50:52,055
I can see that on allocating about 15
mags total

796
00:50:52,055 --> 00:50:55,063
during the process for bringing the app
up and running the task

797
00:50:55,063 --> 00:50:58,087
so what part about is actually in my
apply

798
00:50:58,087 --> 00:51:03,120
nor filter well go ahead and filtered
and we can see that it's just about 430

799
00:51:04,002 --> 00:51:04,048
K

800
00:51:04,066 --> 00:51:07,074
that we're taking that sounds reasonable
and indeed

801
00:51:07,074 --> 00:51:10,145
my factories here is showing me
highlighted the black michaud

802
00:51:11,045 --> 00:51:14,117
so I can see at a glance where it is
rather than drilling down a step at a

803
00:51:15,017 --> 00:51:15,078
time

804
00:51:15,078 --> 00:51:19,116
I can just click on my code and see
where in the stack trace

805
00:51:20,016 --> 00:51:23,081
that occurring and look in detail what's
going on

806
00:51:23,081 --> 00:51:27,083
so instruments again the perfect way to
take and understand more deeply

807
00:51:27,083 --> 00:51:31,169
what's going on now come to a session
later this afternoon to learn more about

808
00:51:32,069 --> 00:51:35,128
not brings us back Xcode everything's
working the way we want

809
00:51:36,028 --> 00:51:39,094
of course my next step is to check and
and when I check and

810
00:51:39,094 --> 00:51:42,096
Xcode server is going to start doing its
work

811
00:51:43,014 --> 00:51:46,017
and we can feel we have a server setup
my team has been using the perfect way

812
00:51:46,044 --> 00:51:46,091
for

813
00:51:46,091 --> 00:51:49,145
a small group of engineers to work
together we've got

814
00:51:50,045 --> 00:51:54,050
overviews here what's going on in my
project so I can feel recent activity

815
00:51:54,095 --> 00:51:57,163
my success tree which is looking good
for being successful and my complete

816
00:51:58,063 --> 00:51:59,068
history

817
00:51:59,068 --> 00:52:02,072
up to a little bit of a rocky start
initially with one failed bill

818
00:52:03,008 --> 00:52:07,085
but but all in all looking good a unit
test count is creeping up

819
00:52:07,085 --> 00:52:10,144
I can see historically what failures
occurred so I might be interested in

820
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:12,072
taking into someone that

821
00:52:12,072 --> 00:52:15,158
I'm really most interested in my most
recent integration

822
00:52:16,058 --> 00:52:19,094
and so fine showdown about integration
and look at all the tests that are

823
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:19,101
running

824
00:52:20,064 --> 00:52:24,112
I can see that I'm not the only one has
been doing performance to

825
00:52:25,012 --> 00:52:28,051
because besides my green check marks
here I'm also seeing

826
00:52:28,051 --> 00:52:32,054
variance from baseline so at a glance
ICANN fee for this last run

827
00:52:32,081 --> 00:52:35,089
that we're doing well against the
baseline in a couple attacked my

828
00:52:35,089 --> 00:52:38,092
coworkers about adding

829
00:52:38,092 --> 00:52:42,104
was great with twist one is open see in
fact that we're tracking baseline

830
00:52:43,004 --> 00:52:46,102
against individual devices so as be
exercised in all the vices

831
00:52:47,002 --> 00:52:50,100
we have individual targets props for
different generations apart where

832
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,088
and I think these numbers are great I
wanna make sure we don't slide from here

833
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:54,159
either

834
00:52:55,059 --> 00:52:58,116
so I can go and and added that baseline
right there

835
00:52:59,016 --> 00:53:03,049
and accept the last run as a baseline
target for all future

836
00:53:03,049 --> 00:53:07,070
on missus spectacular because it means
that from my machine

837
00:53:07,007 --> 00:53:10,092
I can change the baseline push that back
to the server and that baseline will be

838
00:53:11,055 --> 00:53:11,118
updated

839
00:53:12,018 --> 00:53:15,095
on all my coworkers machines so they're
measuring the same target

840
00:53:15,095 --> 00:53:19,151
but I am so I think we've got a
spectacular round-trip process here for

841
00:53:20,051 --> 00:53:20,099
you

842
00:53:20,099 --> 00:53:23,104
you're going to love it and to wrap
things up I'd like to turn it back over

843
00:53:24,004 --> 00:53:25,009
to Mike

844
00:53:25,009 --> 00:53:28,041
thank you cape okay

845
00:53:28,041 --> 00:53:32,119
backtracked good sex the seat is out
there available to all of you

846
00:53:33,019 --> 00:53:36,110
so try it out then please let us know
what you think

847
00:53:37,001 --> 00:53:41,033
this is going to be a great week we have
a condom sessions that were going

848
00:53:41,042 --> 00:53:44,104
into even more detail about all this
about have a great show
