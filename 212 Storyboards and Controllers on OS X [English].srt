1
00:00:13,028 --> 00:00:14,113
good afternoon

2
00:00:15,013 --> 00:00:16,046
welcome to story boards and

3
00:00:16,046 --> 00:00:20,935
trollers on a West End my name's Mike
and I work on the Interface Builder team

4
00:00:21,349 --> 00:00:24,570
today I'd like to show you how you can
build your

5
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:27,256
I was 10 applications faster and easier
using

6
00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:30,807
owning storyboards in Xcode 6 and
Yosemite

7
00:00:31,149 --> 00:00:35,300
I'm also gonna be joined later by my
colleague wrongly from the up kit team

8
00:00:35,003 --> 00:00:38,080
who will come up and take a under the
hood the new controllers API

9
00:00:39,007 --> 00:00:42,996
to make storyboards work so just a quick
show of hands here

10
00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:46,073
who is already building an app today
using

11
00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:49,226
for I West using storyboards I'll

12
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:54,560
awesome cool so a your public notice a
little bit of one but to show you

13
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:58,530
is got pretty familiar so what are we
gonna see

14
00:00:58,053 --> 00:01:01,110
first

15
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:05,044
I'm gonna start by giving you a brief
overview of how storyboards work

16
00:01:05,053 --> 00:01:09,089
then I'm gonna give a demo showing how
you can quickly connect the top level

17
00:01:09,089 --> 00:01:09,171
controllers

18
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:13,077
interface your up together using Xcode
sex

19
00:01:13,077 --> 00:01:17,083
hopefully you'll see how storyboards can
help you structure your app

20
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:20,131
and modular in reusable view controllers
then

21
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:24,068
role is going to come up and show us
that view controller API

22
00:01:24,068 --> 00:01:27,787
we'll see how all the pieces click
together underneath the storyboard

23
00:01:28,399 --> 00:01:28,457
scenes

24
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:33,057
and he'll show you the best places to
hook into the infrastructure and finally

25
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,830
as a bonus he's gonna show you how to
use the new gesture recognizers

26
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:40,920
in West End without having to write an
innocent tracking

27
00:01:40,092 --> 00:01:43,134
all you have to do is just drag connect
to your target in action

28
00:01:44,034 --> 00:01:48,883
are so simple its simply amazing so

29
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:54,224
in Xcode storyboards are great way to
see all you I parts of your application

30
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:58,990
laid out in a way that understand take
for example an application like pages

31
00:01:58,099 --> 00:02:02,468
we can decompose you to the major pieces
the you why

32
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:06,453
into each major section functionality
like the window toolbar

33
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:10,373
the document area and the shape picker
each of these use has a corresponding

34
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,041
controller

35
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:18,470
and we show that the storyboard as from
each scene

36
00:02:18,047 --> 00:02:22,114
represent view and view controller pair
the lines connecting the scenes

37
00:02:23,014 --> 00:02:26,026
know the segways sure the relationships
between

38
00:02:26,026 --> 00:02:29,112
them some of these relationships
represent a containment

39
00:02:30,012 --> 00:02:34,038
view controllers inside each other other
segue lines represent transitions

40
00:02:34,038 --> 00:02:35,079
between view controllers

41
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:41,028
but each one represents flow data in
some form within the app

42
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:45,320
in your code

43
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:48,451
you controllers are where you the
developer actually get your hands and

44
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:50,380
controlling both you why

45
00:02:50,038 --> 00:02:53,093
and the underlying data model each
top-level seem

46
00:02:53,093 --> 00:02:56,362
in a storyboard represents one view
controller in your code

47
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:00,320
each controller is a reusable

48
00:03:00,032 --> 00:03:03,094
self-contained module user interface in
control logic

49
00:03:03,094 --> 00:03:06,100
within that controller seen you can do
everything you would normally do inside

50
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:07,463
Ibiza

51
00:03:07,949 --> 00:03:11,993
file like place the Y set up auto layout
constraints

52
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:16,820
connect outlets and actions to their
parents you controllers

53
00:03:16,082 --> 00:03:19,871
and it's represented object so how to be
seen

54
00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:23,628
actually connect with each other well

55
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:26,880
segways are really in the glue or the
connective tissues

56
00:03:27,609 --> 00:03:31,668
between each the major blocks off your
caps you why you may have noticed

57
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:35,500
the on I West Singh was usually
represent transition

58
00:03:35,005 --> 00:03:38,994
between whole full-screen views we took
a look at

59
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:42,870
the relationships between view
controllers and West End though

60
00:03:42,087 --> 00:03:45,916
we noticed somewhat different
relationship containment

61
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:49,787
on almost ten most applications tend to
group their views together

62
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:53,650
in the same window there are many
transitions bring

63
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:57,144
views on and off-screen because you
actually have the screen real estate to

64
00:03:57,729 --> 00:03:58,470
show the mall

65
00:03:58,047 --> 00:04:02,156
inside the same window summer grouped in
splits or sometimes hidden tabs

66
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:05,592
that's not to say that we don't have

67
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:09,752
presentation sideways on our 10 as well
we just have fewer of them

68
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:13,690
at modal dialogs when the model sheets

69
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:16,084
and popovers like the presentation
segways

70
00:04:16,084 --> 00:04:20,223
on i OS in order to make these work it's
your responsibility to override the

71
00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:22,470
prepare for Segway

72
00:04:22,047 --> 00:04:25,066
method in your parent you controller

73
00:04:25,066 --> 00:04:29,111
from there you can take the past and and
a storyboard segue object

74
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:34,062
get the destination view controller that
and configure and set the represented

75
00:04:34,062 --> 00:04:36,351
object or do any other initialization

76
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:40,978
right before it's presented up on screen

77
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,684
so if there's one line of code that is
absolutely necessary and that you need

78
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:44,545
to remember

79
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:49,590
its prepare for Segway

80
00:04:49,059 --> 00:04:52,134
so at build time each storyboard scene
is broken down

81
00:04:53,034 --> 00:04:57,613
into each its constituent parts views
are separated from view controllers

82
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,925
windows are separated from winter
controllers and the transition segways

83
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:05,050
are embedded inside of their parent
controllers

84
00:05:05,689 --> 00:05:08,770
this is done to make the process a
lowering your user interface

85
00:05:08,077 --> 00:05:12,506
as lazy as possible at runtime then as
performance optimization

86
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,202
the container controllers absorb all
other child controllers together in the

87
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:19,370
same unit

88
00:05:19,037 --> 00:05:22,826
this is because all those controllers
are going to be needed the initial load

89
00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:23,203
time

90
00:05:23,599 --> 00:05:27,605
the top-level container controller and
it's just more efficient

91
00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:31,110
on archive 14 then each unit

92
00:05:31,011 --> 00:05:34,320
is compiled into a net file and then all
the noobs

93
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:37,494
are bundled together inside about
storyboard see bundle

94
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:42,190
then that bundles nestled inside of your
applications resources director

95
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:46,240
and then appear up can go to the store

96
00:05:46,024 --> 00:05:49,090
so we put a lot of our and work into the
storyboard compiler

97
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:53,058
to make sure you get the most fission
loading at runtime while in use the most

98
00:05:53,949 --> 00:05:54,953
flexible yuan Lai

99
00:05:55,349 --> 00:05:59,770
to be able to connect in rewire the
relationships between your controllers

100
00:05:59,077 --> 00:06:03,056
on campus all with the absolute minimum
glucose

101
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:07,774
so we'll see how this all works over
here on the demolition

102
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:11,041
so as a way of testing storyboards

103
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:14,512
and to make sure that everything that
we're buildings actually working

104
00:06:15,349 --> 00:06:18,610
we started by rewriting an all peace
sample code

105
00:06:18,061 --> 00:06:21,370
that you may be familiar with called
sketch

106
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,947
in our story board based sketch the next
generation

107
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:29,330
we're taking a class a document based
app and we're

108
00:06:29,033 --> 00:06:32,872
remodeling much in control logic
interview controllers

109
00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:37,224
so as you can see here we have the main
story board over application

110
00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:41,240
it already has a number of scenes that
we've pre-populated ins

111
00:06:41,024 --> 00:06:44,753
with view controllers and

112
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:48,120
what we want to do is to show you why
that has

113
00:06:48,012 --> 00:06:51,033
are campus where you can drop shapes

114
00:06:51,033 --> 00:06:55,065
and use gestures to manipulate them and
then have a split

115
00:06:55,065 --> 00:06:59,304
and on the other side of that would be
will be the inspector area

116
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:02,950
where you can see the different
properties the currently selected shape

117
00:07:03,499 --> 00:07:08,590
so to model this I'm going to use a
split view controller

118
00:07:08,059 --> 00:07:11,348
and I'm just gonna drag that out into
the campus here

119
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:15,330
and it comes with two controllers
already which I don't really mean

120
00:07:15,033 --> 00:07:17,392
because I already have my campus

121
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:20,695
I can just wire up here

122
00:07:21,289 --> 00:07:24,330
and drag connect and Chris

123
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:27,736
I'm out that and then we wanna where

124
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:33,210
inspectors well and you can see here we
have like a little preview

125
00:07:33,021 --> 00:07:36,540
love with the campus in the inspector
look like and it's using

126
00:07:36,729 --> 00:07:41,080
the auto layout constraints that have
already been set in those views

127
00:07:41,008 --> 00:07:44,807
also to get this to show up we wanna
take are window controller

128
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,913
and connect the new split view
controller and say that this is going to

129
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:49,260
be the windows

130
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:52,800
content view controller so

131
00:07:52,008 --> 00:07:56,014
a looks like all other boxes have old
lines connected to him let's

132
00:07:56,086 --> 00:07:59,665
run this and shows up

133
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:04,550
top here is an app our application

134
00:08:04,055 --> 00:08:08,424
and as iris 5 you'll notice that

135
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:11,990
you know we have a good enforced minimum
size from

136
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:14,180
our auto layout constraints but the
split is not

137
00:08:15,008 --> 00:08:18,099
sticking kind of to the side where we
would want it as we resize the window

138
00:08:19,071 --> 00:08:20,080
just keeps getting bigger

139
00:08:21,061 --> 00:08:24,062
so I know what I can do to fix this

140
00:08:24,062 --> 00:08:27,121
I just have to go to the split view
controller

141
00:08:28,021 --> 00:08:32,094
and find the split view item corresponds
to that

142
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:35,140
and I can the holding priority

143
00:08:36,004 --> 00:08:39,009
the split to be just a little bit more
than the default

144
00:08:39,009 --> 00:08:43,012
and what we're here we must market is
saying can collapse because you know

145
00:08:44,002 --> 00:08:47,026
might not want to always see details I
love the

146
00:08:47,044 --> 00:08:50,067
shapes on campus cell let's run

147
00:08:50,067 --> 00:08:53,114
help looks

148
00:08:54,014 --> 00:08:58,050
alright now as a drag this we notice
that the

149
00:08:58,005 --> 00:09:01,012
split view edge is actually hugging the
side window

150
00:09:01,057 --> 00:09:04,124
as we won its so train at shape

151
00:09:05,024 --> 00:09:08,039
0 and it looks like we don't have our

152
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:11,044
shape Add button hooked up so

153
00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:14,142
I'm going to create a new kind of segue

154
00:09:15,042 --> 00:09:18,125
and I'm going to show the shape picker
controller

155
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:22,060
as a popover

156
00:09:22,006 --> 00:09:25,008
and in order to make this work though

157
00:09:25,062 --> 00:09:29,136
there is one one piece of code that we
all have to remember

158
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:33,129
to implement in order for up these two
workers

159
00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:37,034
the prepare for Segway

160
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:41,071
so I'm actually gonna open up the
assistant editor

161
00:09:41,071 --> 00:09:45,112
and should see

162
00:09:46,012 --> 00:09:50,023
the canvas you control it here we go and
it looks like somebody

163
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:53,045
has already helpfully written code for
me so I'm just gonna and comment

164
00:09:53,045 --> 00:09:56,094
here and what it does is it takes the

165
00:09:56,094 --> 00:09:59,139
destination view controller I love the
past in

166
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:03,081
and a storyboard segue and what we're
doing is we're

167
00:10:03,081 --> 00:10:06,163
initializing to and saying that it the
ship container

168
00:10:07,063 --> 00:10:10,109
is going to be the campus which is
ourself in this case

169
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:15,011
campus initiating the Segway and it's
also going to be the destination where

170
00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:16,045
one add new

171
00:10:16,045 --> 00:10:23,045
checked so let's build and run us

172
00:10:25,037 --> 00:10:28,063
and when we click on great

173
00:10:28,063 --> 00:10:31,144
so now we have a shape a can't

174
00:10:32,044 --> 00:10:35,077
seemed do anything with it can't move it
by

175
00:10:35,077 --> 00:10:38,093
I think I'll leave that for Raleigh

176
00:10:38,093 --> 00:10:41,134
but as one more little bonus before I
leave a

177
00:10:42,034 --> 00:10:45,067
I want to you hookup what is going to be

178
00:10:45,067 --> 00:10:49,142
a Preferences window and I just wanna
show you just how easy this is cuz

179
00:10:50,042 --> 00:10:54,090
this is on my favorite features I just
couldn't wait to show you

180
00:10:54,009 --> 00:10:58,045
I am right here we have tab view
controller

181
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:03,067
that has both general prepping and some
keyboard shortcuts

182
00:11:03,067 --> 00:11:06,090
and what I can do is I can wire the SUP

183
00:11:06,009 --> 00:11:09,015
to the preference is menu item

184
00:11:09,096 --> 00:11:12,150
and just say for the Sega demo words
gonna show this is a moral

185
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:16,086
dialogue and fire on this

186
00:11:17,031 --> 00:11:20,082
you notice that we have

187
00:11:20,082 --> 00:11:23,109
a sketch with

188
00:11:24,009 --> 00:11:27,054
fully functional preferences you notice
the nice no new crossfade

189
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:30,063
between these two views which comes with
the temp controller

190
00:11:31,044 --> 00:11:35,113
but this isn't look exactly like
preferences when to you still

191
00:11:36,013 --> 00:11:39,017
one other really call options that'll
been added

192
00:11:39,017 --> 00:11:43,028
to you have you controller is a new
style

193
00:11:43,028 --> 00:11:46,066
besides just happens on top or tabs on
bottom

194
00:11:46,066 --> 00:11:49,153
we can actually say we won toward bar
style tabs

195
00:11:50,053 --> 00:11:54,055
and we actually specified the class

196
00:11:54,055 --> 00:11:57,112
our view controllers in this case this
is the general

197
00:11:58,012 --> 00:12:01,040
prep Spain you controller and this one

198
00:12:01,004 --> 00:12:04,007
is the he Board Short

199
00:12:04,043 --> 00:12:07,045
you controller I we will find

200
00:12:07,063 --> 00:12:10,070
with in your document the

201
00:12:11,033 --> 00:12:14,048
emit images that are named the same

202
00:12:14,048 --> 00:12:18,048
as the class love the view controller

203
00:12:18,048 --> 00:12:21,074
so when we run s now

204
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:25,075
you'll see

205
00:12:25,084 --> 00:12:28,160
new Preferences window have the icon

206
00:12:29,006 --> 00:12:33,031
and the titles fewer

207
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:39,159
the trial began

208
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:43,073
switch back to fly

209
00:12:43,073 --> 00:12:47,145
so how easy was that just by wearing a
few segways on campus

210
00:12:48,045 --> 00:12:51,121
and overriding prepare for Segway we
were able to plumb together the view

211
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:52,094
controllers

212
00:12:52,094 --> 00:12:55,142
into a fully functional application
Preferences window

213
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:59,087
didn't even use a single line of code
cell

214
00:12:59,087 --> 00:13:02,092
now I'd like to ask rally to come up
Angeles house reports

215
00:13:02,092 --> 00:13:09,092
actually works under the hood thank you
Mike

216
00:13:12,037 --> 00:13:15,069
now that you've seen how incredibly easy
it is

217
00:13:15,069 --> 00:13:19,090
to design your application using
storyboards and the wire everything up

218
00:13:19,009 --> 00:13:22,061
I'm gonna pop open the hood I'm going to
take a look at the machinery and any

219
00:13:23,042 --> 00:13:27,056
that drives this whole thing

220
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:31,059
we got a lot to cover here just a little
bit of API with storyboards itself

221
00:13:31,086 --> 00:13:34,141
there's a lot of new API we view
controllers we talk a little bit about

222
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:37,054
how window controllers fits in with

223
00:13:37,054 --> 00:13:40,109
a arpa liberation %uh view controllers
that we're now adding

224
00:13:41,009 --> 00:13:44,098
and wrap it up with gesture recognizers
and how they

225
00:13:44,098 --> 00:13:47,117
really mesh ruling night with view
controllers

226
00:13:48,017 --> 00:13:51,041
and designing application it's really
awesome

227
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:54,046
loved it right in with storyboards
storyboards

228
00:13:54,091 --> 00:13:58,169
or every source file in your project
like nerves or

229
00:13:59,069 --> 00:14:02,078
by default you the if you to the check
box when you create a new project a good

230
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:04,064
start off with the storyboard

231
00:14:05,009 --> 00:14:08,018
are you discredit storyboarding in your
project a new one

232
00:14:08,018 --> 00:14:11,021
in the setting for the project for your
target

233
00:14:11,021 --> 00:14:14,027
you could just right there in the main
interface set which storyboard to use as

234
00:14:14,081 --> 00:14:15,084
your main interface

235
00:14:16,011 --> 00:14:20,046
are even if I'll if you happen to have
be transitioning from a no project to no

236
00:14:20,046 --> 00:14:20,083
one

237
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:24,085
and the right thing will happen if you
by yourself with the need to dig down

238
00:14:25,003 --> 00:14:27,092
into the unpopular stands at the keys
manually

239
00:14:27,092 --> 00:14:30,171
the in its main story board file this is
the key you need to set near

240
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:36,086
if popular to bring up the storyboard

241
00:14:36,086 --> 00:14:39,152
we load the initial storyboard is gonna
go through this path

242
00:14:40,052 --> 00:14:43,143
just like you can use this API struggle
with name to load any so reported that

243
00:14:44,043 --> 00:14:45,089
you have in your resources

244
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:49,151
you could order from a name and then you
need to instantiate the initial

245
00:14:50,051 --> 00:14:51,106
controller

246
00:14:52,006 --> 00:14:55,091
what's the initial controlling my task
well that the controller that has the

247
00:14:55,091 --> 00:14:56,187
arrow pointing to it without

248
00:14:57,087 --> 00:15:00,156
some beginning part to it this is the
initial guy there's always one upping

249
00:15:01,056 --> 00:15:02,073
with your storyboard

250
00:15:02,073 --> 00:15:06,076
that's gonna be the initial control
earnest generally when you wanna load up

251
00:15:06,076 --> 00:15:09,165
when with OJ Mayo storyboard file world
automatically instantiate initial

252
00:15:10,065 --> 00:15:11,112
controller and said it running

253
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:15,039
on your behalf not

254
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,046
every controller that you have in your
storyboard need to be wired back

255
00:15:19,009 --> 00:15:22,087
up to that initial view controller I'm
you can have them they just stand alone

256
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,166
all on their own and can give the man
died in a fire and you can

257
00:15:25,066 --> 00:15:29,084
access them by getting the asking to
instantiate the controller with identify

258
00:15:29,084 --> 00:15:29,156
our

259
00:15:30,056 --> 00:15:33,068
will find it in the store but with that
name will instantiate start doing the

260
00:15:33,068 --> 00:15:33,136
wiring up

261
00:15:34,036 --> 00:15:38,125
and headed back to you and you can take
from there

262
00:15:39,025 --> 00:15:42,069
that's really all there is with
storyboards as far as a PI

263
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:47,134
its there's not much there they just
work it's really nice

264
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:51,129
view controllers move on to view
controllers there's

265
00:15:52,029 --> 00:15:55,062
ton have new API here there's so much
like your view controllers that I've got

266
00:15:55,062 --> 00:15:56,159
a breakdown in the sections

267
00:15:57,059 --> 00:16:01,068
so we'll talk about loading and layout
life cycle there but container ship

268
00:16:01,068 --> 00:16:04,112
it's really nice mister for container
ship triggered segways

269
00:16:05,012 --> 00:16:08,070
as you saw the plus button to do the
popover and will wrap it up with how to

270
00:16:08,007 --> 00:16:09,071
do things completely manual

271
00:16:10,034 --> 00:16:13,110
if you need to get down to that level

272
00:16:14,001 --> 00:16:17,010
so have a lot of properties in a in a
few controller for loading this plan

273
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,068
layout

274
00:16:18,068 --> 00:16:23,152
all these methods here are new except
for view loaded which is the top one

275
00:16:24,052 --> 00:16:29,087
and wanna talk about them is unknown
life cycle and how they're used

276
00:16:29,087 --> 00:16:32,136
you have your view controller will get a
knitted and allocated

277
00:16:33,036 --> 00:16:35,128
and it doesn't have a view yet because
view controllers like to lately though

278
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,109
the view so there's no view yet

279
00:16:38,009 --> 00:16:43,060
you load it is gonna return 0 if yes
first property at this point

280
00:16:43,006 --> 00:16:47,011
then load view was going to get called a
this is generally been the place where

281
00:16:47,065 --> 00:16:48,104
you've gone ahead and

282
00:16:49,004 --> 00:16:52,039
so class in a few control an overload
override load view

283
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:56,112
just the cost to burn normally by
default at get will go ahead and try and

284
00:16:57,012 --> 00:16:58,061
load the nearby

285
00:16:58,061 --> 00:17:01,079
with the name that you gave it a few
initial I did it with near where

286
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:04,248
the net worth name but new

287
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,967
on your seventy is that you will go
ahead and

288
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:12,120
if your nickname is nil will look for a
nearby that has the same

289
00:17:12,012 --> 00:17:15,681
name as your view controller and
automatically know that name for you

290
00:17:15,789 --> 00:17:19,890
so now you have the subclass view
controller to get the right near bloated

291
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:22,218
you just name your net file the right
thing and

292
00:17:23,019 --> 00:17:26,970
it'll do it for you automatically

293
00:17:26,097 --> 00:17:29,119
during load view said he was going to
get called in your view is finally set

294
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:33,083
your view controller you load it will
now return yes

295
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:36,088
they were returned from load view but
before we continue the run though before

296
00:17:37,033 --> 00:17:37,042
we go back

297
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:42,182
to giving control unification view did
load is going to be can

298
00:17:42,389 --> 00:17:45,430
called on your view controller it is at
this point now instead of overwriting

299
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:46,730
love you

300
00:17:46,073 --> 00:17:49,632
you're right you did load and you do you
want I miss then she Asian

301
00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:53,860
finalization stuff that you need to do
there so this is something that you only

302
00:17:53,086 --> 00:17:53,495
do

303
00:17:54,269 --> 00:17:57,950
want to be wants when the view is loaded
and you'll never need to do again

304
00:17:57,095 --> 00:17:57,544
because

305
00:17:58,399 --> 00:18:01,940
your view is going to be hanging around

306
00:18:01,094 --> 00:18:06,053
now you gonna go ahead in which have you
in a window get the window on screen

307
00:18:06,899 --> 00:18:12,210
and gonna go to the life cycle love you

308
00:18:12,021 --> 00:18:15,098
so before you gets in the window as you
added into the window

309
00:18:15,098 --> 00:18:18,627
I will call you will appear and there
are few other places that you will

310
00:18:19,509 --> 00:18:20,460
appear gets called

311
00:18:20,046 --> 00:18:23,083
whenever the window is becoming visible
for example

312
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:27,682
as ordering a front perhaps the user has
previously hidden the wind or minimize

313
00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:29,437
it and now they're

314
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:32,580
on minimizing the window into this is
another case where you get

315
00:18:32,058 --> 00:18:35,096
love you will appear see to do some
really interesting things here for

316
00:18:35,096 --> 00:18:35,169
example

317
00:18:36,069 --> 00:18:39,070
arm you might wanna so what

318
00:18:39,007 --> 00:18:43,306
sector highlight color so the first time
that give you that the draw

319
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:48,030
draws with the correct highlight color
for example

320
00:18:48,309 --> 00:18:51,830
generation is now going to occur after
you return from this

321
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:54,532
the window will be animated on screen if
you're on hiding the view are you doing

322
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:57,285
so got a transition a transition
animation occurs

323
00:18:57,879 --> 00:19:01,330
when that completing your you is drawn
at least once

324
00:19:01,033 --> 00:19:04,058
you did appeal because in the view
controller and now you can wire up

325
00:19:04,058 --> 00:19:06,607
things that you didn't want to interfere
with that information

326
00:19:07,129 --> 00:19:10,205
and you only want to be visible while
the window is visible in your viewers

327
00:19:10,889 --> 00:19:11,580
displayed

328
00:19:11,058 --> 00:19:15,727
you might want to set up 27 example some
animation that's running here

329
00:19:16,249 --> 00:19:22,255
a the disrupt costly but only wanted
visible

330
00:19:22,309 --> 00:19:26,570
at this point user interacts with your
view interact with the user interface

331
00:19:26,057 --> 00:19:29,286
you gonna update you constraints on your
view you gonna dirty them

332
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:32,811
you can't really get the participate and
updating the constraints with the day if

333
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:33,580
you can't read

334
00:19:33,058 --> 00:19:36,061
and you get informed when layout is
gonna happen with the will lay out and

335
00:19:36,061 --> 00:19:37,710
after it happened you did lay out

336
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:41,580
see you can participate in this is you
normally would with

337
00:19:41,058 --> 00:19:46,157
our way out arm but you get to do it now
if you control level

338
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:49,679
and at some point you can remove the
view from the window perhaps you've

339
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,590
changed had now the view with

340
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:55,144
being hidden are you hiding the one to
the user's hiding the window or you just

341
00:19:56,044 --> 00:19:57,523
outright closing the window

342
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,992
any these cases your will be pursued
with a view will disappear

343
00:20:01,649 --> 00:20:03,740
that animation we started in view did
appear this is what we would want to

344
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,710
stop it

345
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:09,160
then the animation occurs in the view
out the window disappears with the

346
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:12,850
appropriate animation and will call you
back with a view did disappear

347
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:17,320
and now you can release a any kind a
final resources that you don't wanna

348
00:20:17,032 --> 00:20:18,037
hang onto as the window

349
00:20:18,082 --> 00:20:22,119
is not visible or your view is no longer
part of the window

350
00:20:23,019 --> 00:20:26,988
the life cycle just continues as you
switch tabs in the views come back in

351
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:28,247
Galway in Windows hide/show

352
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:34,110
we just continue the cycle

353
00:20:34,011 --> 00:20:37,920
new in Yosemite in a few controllers now
in the responder chain

354
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:41,480
where for would start off with our
campus you with we had no demo

355
00:20:41,048 --> 00:20:43,077
application there

356
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:47,534
in a benefit at the campus few inflows
up through the split view to the window

357
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:51,700
and follow you into a controller

358
00:20:51,007 --> 00:20:54,226
if you control is there came a few to
respect split you control cannot

359
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:56,090
participate in this

360
00:20:56,009 --> 00:21:00,588
and their automatically wired up in the
responder chain right after their view

361
00:21:00,669 --> 00:21:03,766
so you can now participate in events and
more importantly an action methods

362
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:08,460
in action method the road is where
really comes in handy

363
00:21:08,046 --> 00:21:12,265
up for example cut copy and paste in the
menu bar cut copy paste

364
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:16,940
this wired up to the cut copy and paste
actions to the first responder

365
00:21:16,094 --> 00:21:19,813
that might be the campus view in this
case like Eva you doesn't really do much

366
00:21:20,659 --> 00:21:22,694
more thorough logic is that our campus
view controller

367
00:21:23,009 --> 00:21:26,026
and previously you would have had to you

368
00:21:26,179 --> 00:21:30,204
catch pick up the pace in your view and
somehow back get a two-year

369
00:21:30,429 --> 00:21:33,478
controller and now back in a few
controllers

370
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,925
in the responder chain you can put their
copy method writing your campus view

371
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:38,200
controller

372
00:21:38,002 --> 00:21:41,101
and give you can be a totally oblivious
to this

373
00:21:42,019 --> 00:21:47,128
and it works out really nicely I do want
to point out though that we only wire up

374
00:21:47,299 --> 00:21:50,311
view controllers automatically and
respond to change if you're late on or

375
00:21:50,419 --> 00:21:53,458
after ten 10

376
00:21:53,809 --> 00:21:56,690
suitable for talk about to tame it we
got some really exciting things to do

377
00:21:56,069 --> 00:21:57,058
with containment

378
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:01,750
you controllers can now have children
and you can't get back your parent

379
00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:05,412
in the best way to talk about the
payment it with an example so let's

380
00:22:05,619 --> 00:22:07,657
start off with pay per view controller
with that Deepika

381
00:22:07,999 --> 00:22:12,002
into have you controller so in a Feb
controllers

382
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:16,345
going to manage in a February manages a
couple of other views and I'll get into

383
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:16,845
details there but

384
00:22:17,619 --> 00:22:20,645
mainly manages the tab you it's going to

385
00:22:20,879 --> 00:22:24,980
lately loaded have to use and this is
one of my favorite things

386
00:22:24,098 --> 00:22:27,144
and a path life I've had have used that
had

387
00:22:28,044 --> 00:22:31,099
a fair number of tabs on a lot a carton
in each one of those tabs

388
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:34,238
and loading this never far from death
took forever

389
00:22:35,129 --> 00:22:38,700
now that we lately low that have used
just the initial select the tab is going

390
00:22:38,007 --> 00:22:40,446
to get loaded when you first bring up
your interface

391
00:22:41,139 --> 00:22:47,166
and it is much more responsive to the
user that way I really love this

392
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:50,840
its now much easier to customize your
had

393
00:22:50,084 --> 00:22:53,393
using a tabbed view controller and I'll
get into specifics about that a little

394
00:22:54,149 --> 00:22:55,580
bit

395
00:22:55,058 --> 00:22:59,367
and as you saw in the demo it's
incredibly easy without code you can

396
00:22:59,889 --> 00:23:03,976
get a nice profit is user interface star
using a tab you controller

397
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:07,830
and I'll show you exactly how you would
do that encode and its

398
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:12,149
just as easy as we as Mike did in the
demo and I B

399
00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:16,088
I maverick's in a fabulous like this
there's

400
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:19,544
and Anna have you it manages the
collection have been a have you items

401
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:19,712
those

402
00:23:20,009 --> 00:23:23,022
to view items each have a view and some
additional properties

403
00:23:23,139 --> 00:23:27,180
such as the label so we know what label
to put in the tabs

404
00:23:27,549 --> 00:23:30,970
with have your controller logically
things are now

405
00:23:30,097 --> 00:23:33,133
%uh laid out like this there's an attack
view controller

406
00:23:34,033 --> 00:23:38,046
and that have you controller owns in it
have you

407
00:23:38,046 --> 00:23:41,515
and manages the collection have been
attacked you items

408
00:23:41,929 --> 00:23:44,980
to have you in a February now has a
couple of additional properties

409
00:23:44,098 --> 00:23:47,145
the image which is kinda fun she can get
an image in there

410
00:23:48,045 --> 00:23:51,069
and of course the view controller and if
the view controller that

411
00:23:51,069 --> 00:23:54,398
now owns the view and it can lead to
reload the view

412
00:23:55,019 --> 00:24:00,082
as you switch to the steps

413
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:03,960
since in effect you could tell a manager
the collection of tap you items you can

414
00:24:03,096 --> 00:24:03,785
of course

415
00:24:04,649 --> 00:24:08,700
get that have you item array you can
also find out what the selected have you

416
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:10,070
item indexes

417
00:24:10,007 --> 00:24:13,076
in this is cave you comply it so you can
observe this

418
00:24:13,139 --> 00:24:16,580
is much easier to observe the selected
to view item index then it was

419
00:24:16,058 --> 00:24:17,217
previously to

420
00:24:17,739 --> 00:24:21,570
have a delegate and a have to respond
all the delegate methods

421
00:24:21,057 --> 00:24:25,036
so you have to do that anymore as with
any sort of containment

422
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:28,637
API there's the at insert removed a few
items

423
00:24:29,429 --> 00:24:32,452
and if you have a child view controller
that

424
00:24:32,659 --> 00:24:35,757
is in what are the tags you can just ask
for that have your item associated with

425
00:24:36,639 --> 00:24:36,678
it

426
00:24:37,029 --> 00:24:42,032
be a tad view item for view controller

427
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:46,142
in a February damn also had this really
nifty a class method on it

428
00:24:46,889 --> 00:24:50,460
to view item with a view controller she
could take any

429
00:24:50,046 --> 00:24:53,205
no dinner view controller that you have
and you can create

430
00:24:53,619 --> 00:24:57,658
a default have you controller for it
using this method

431
00:24:58,009 --> 00:25:02,046
and what this does is it doesn't just
create a generic have you item it tries

432
00:25:02,379 --> 00:25:02,421
to

433
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,080
populated with the appropriate
information from the

434
00:25:06,008 --> 00:25:09,327
to view controller for example we will
take the title

435
00:25:09,399 --> 00:25:12,860
a bitch i love u controller and said
that the label other have you item

436
00:25:12,086 --> 00:25:15,625
and you will also take it a step further
as Mike should in the demo

437
00:25:16,399 --> 00:25:19,960
we look at the a class them at the view
controller

438
00:25:19,096 --> 00:25:22,170
and we try and find image resources with
that same name are we prefer

439
00:25:23,007 --> 00:25:27,576
is the name with a dash to view item and
will automatically set that image

440
00:25:28,269 --> 00:25:32,450
as the image other tab at the end of
have you item

441
00:25:32,045 --> 00:25:37,964
so you can get the label in the item
just automatically that way

442
00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:41,388
to view controller had a medicinal
properties which are pretty interesting

443
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:45,620
there's the tabs style as Mike show do
we have said made a control on top

444
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:50,267
it on bottom arm so the tab now drawn
with the segmented control

445
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:54,237
touch on it a little bit more real soon
there's the tow bar style

446
00:25:55,029 --> 00:25:59,031
that's all you have to do you set the
taps out the toolbar

447
00:25:59,049 --> 00:26:02,330
that have you control will create the
toolbar on your behalf

448
00:26:02,033 --> 00:26:05,722
and place it in the window at the Tabor
you're done

449
00:26:06,019 --> 00:26:09,054
then there's on specify which is really
interesting and I'll get to that a

450
00:26:09,369 --> 00:26:10,385
little bit more

451
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:13,552
and just the second at the talked about
not

452
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:17,980
there is a segmented control that now
displays the tabs

453
00:26:17,098 --> 00:26:20,737
you can get the segmented control you
can supply your own segments control

454
00:26:21,619 --> 00:26:23,320
subclass if you want draw them

455
00:26:23,032 --> 00:26:28,061
a in your subclass however you wish

456
00:26:28,061 --> 00:26:31,940
but if you said it the PAP style to
unspecified

457
00:26:32,489 --> 00:26:35,583
what you can do then is going apply your
own

458
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:39,454
a layout constraints to the segmented
control

459
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,610
and have the same a control appear where
you want to appear in to the layout

460
00:26:43,061 --> 00:26:44,630
yourself

461
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:48,210
so you have much more customizability a

462
00:26:48,021 --> 00:26:51,035
with to view controller then you've had
previously

463
00:26:51,035 --> 00:26:55,304
there some transition options by
automatically by default we said it

464
00:26:55,619 --> 00:26:55,700
across a

465
00:26:56,429 --> 00:27:00,970
Mike showed in this damn in the demo I T
a change have-not provinces you I

466
00:27:00,097 --> 00:27:04,098
did nice little cross fade effect you
can set it to nine and have

467
00:27:04,098 --> 00:27:08,195
the old style we're just switches we
have very of lighting directions

468
00:27:09,095 --> 00:27:12,184
up down left and right you can combine

469
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:16,590
directions that are on different axes
seeking a bonded up with the left

470
00:27:16,059 --> 00:27:19,238
but you can't combine up with a down
that whitten

471
00:27:19,769 --> 00:27:24,350
actually and made any think so we don't
let you that I do really wanna point out

472
00:27:24,035 --> 00:27:25,058
those slide forward

473
00:27:25,058 --> 00:27:28,084
and slide backwards

474
00:27:28,084 --> 00:27:31,085
these are really important you gonna do
any sort of horizontal sliding because

475
00:27:31,085 --> 00:27:31,173
they work

476
00:27:32,073 --> 00:27:35,172
in the appropriate direction for user's
language so they were correctly and

477
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:39,381
right to left languages they will go the
right way and they will go

478
00:27:40,029 --> 00:27:43,590
the a correct way for left-right
languages as well

479
00:27:43,059 --> 00:27:47,268
an out do just let at get worry about
what the right directions or

480
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:51,821
and we'll handle that for you

481
00:27:52,019 --> 00:27:56,024
as I mentioned in a Feb controller
manages a tad view item id owned it have

482
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:01,580
a and an author view it owned it have
you

483
00:28:01,058 --> 00:28:04,133
so it's important that you let in a have
you control and manage it for you you

484
00:28:05,033 --> 00:28:06,852
don't really need to get to it and
change it

485
00:28:07,149 --> 00:28:10,480
there are a few properties very few
properties

486
00:28:10,048 --> 00:28:13,557
that you can modify directly get a
better view

487
00:28:13,989 --> 00:28:16,850
if you find you really need to do this'
look at the InnoTab 2 controller header

488
00:28:16,085 --> 00:28:17,114
it specifies

489
00:28:17,879 --> 00:28:21,340
exactly what you can set but in general

490
00:28:21,034 --> 00:28:24,933
let's have you control a manager I also
want to point out here that

491
00:28:25,239 --> 00:28:30,100
as interview controller is apart view
controller it has a view

492
00:28:30,001 --> 00:28:35,770
view is not that have you capital has a
view that contains a tab view

493
00:28:35,869 --> 00:28:38,913
at a segmented control and perhaps other
views as

494
00:28:39,309 --> 00:28:43,342
have you could challenge to manage it so
let to view controller

495
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:48,640
handle it for you when you're using a
tow bar style

496
00:28:48,649 --> 00:28:52,100
a in a Feb controller is the delegate

497
00:28:52,001 --> 00:28:55,074
up the toolbar you might wanna

498
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:58,672
override these methods credit so casa
minha have you control an override his

499
00:28:59,419 --> 00:29:02,420
delegate methods

500
00:29:02,429 --> 00:29:05,514
perhaps you want to do something like
add some additional items to the toolbar

501
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:10,365
a that or taps for example a search
field right

502
00:29:11,139 --> 00:29:15,141
you want to search for the purposes you
I search is a tab

503
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:18,190
so you'll meet ok override these two
were delegate method

504
00:29:18,019 --> 00:29:21,468
an answer the search field yourself I do
want to point out that

505
00:29:21,639 --> 00:29:24,738
these have the night and it requires
super attribute on them

506
00:29:25,629 --> 00:29:28,715
so if you do override this method you
must call super and the compiler will

507
00:29:29,489 --> 00:29:32,528
help you remember that

508
00:29:32,879 --> 00:29:35,895
letter view controller let's take a look
at another example we're introducing

509
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:38,124
split view controller in your seventy

510
00:29:38,889 --> 00:29:43,986
it manages in a split view it does lazy
loading a views

511
00:29:44,859 --> 00:29:47,928
and it requires auto layout does all
love the

512
00:29:48,549 --> 00:29:52,573
managing up the splits and how they move
with 12 resizing all view our way out

513
00:29:52,789 --> 00:29:55,813
it would just start adding constraints
to your window

514
00:29:56,029 --> 00:29:59,128
but we have all migrated our ups forward
to using auto layout so that won't be a

515
00:30:00,019 --> 00:30:05,044
problem right

516
00:30:05,269 --> 00:30:09,295
so it would you controller today on
maverick's it has a in a split view

517
00:30:09,529 --> 00:30:14,590
it manages to a more views and as a
divider in there

518
00:30:14,059 --> 00:30:17,120
with and in a split view controller
logic with no they don't like this

519
00:30:18,002 --> 00:30:19,076
enough but view controller owns

520
00:30:19,094 --> 00:30:22,703
and in a split view it manages the
collection of love you items

521
00:30:23,549 --> 00:30:26,820
those items have some nice new
properties in a split

522
00:30:26,082 --> 00:30:30,311
enough view item is a completely new
class in Yosemite

523
00:30:31,049 --> 00:30:34,107
of course it has a view controller which
will easily load view

524
00:30:34,629 --> 00:30:37,718
if the property such as collapse can
collapse in the holding priority

525
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:44,350
Mike showed you how important holding
priority is arm

526
00:30:44,035 --> 00:30:47,924
days or property that you used to have
to override the delegate for split view

527
00:30:48,239 --> 00:30:50,254
would be the delegate for the love you
control you don't need to do that

528
00:30:50,389 --> 00:30:52,431
anymore you just said these properties
right on

529
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:55,820
the split view item so it's a lot easier
to do it that way

530
00:30:55,082 --> 00:30:58,801
and of course you can create a default
view item if you have some child view

531
00:30:59,539 --> 00:31:01,584
controller

532
00:31:01,989 --> 00:31:06,993
Pro tip: if you wanna enemy aside a
collapsible

533
00:31:07,029 --> 00:31:10,125
split you use the enemy to proxy on the
split view item

534
00:31:10,989 --> 00:31:14,027
pieces per view item animator that
collapsed yes or no

535
00:31:14,369 --> 00:31:18,418
an the collapse or expansion animation
will happen for you and I

536
00:31:18,859 --> 00:31:21,937
nice animated fashion

537
00:31:22,639 --> 00:31:26,080
medicinal properties since we manage
collections but you items of course you

538
00:31:26,008 --> 00:31:26,547
can get to the

539
00:31:26,619 --> 00:31:29,668
view items array the obligatory at
insert removed

540
00:31:30,109 --> 00:31:34,840
view item and if you have a child you
control you can find its associated

541
00:31:34,084 --> 00:31:41,084
view item by asking split you item for
view controller

542
00:31:42,529 --> 00:31:45,950
now we'll take a look look at a couple
examples that we're doing that kid

543
00:31:45,095 --> 00:31:49,034
I wanna point out in stressed the
pattern were using hear you

544
00:31:49,889 --> 00:31:51,987
in this the pattern that we think you
should use as well if you find any to

545
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:53,874
write your own containment style

546
00:31:54,369 --> 00:31:58,371
view controllers is you get a view
controller that's going to manage some

547
00:31:58,389 --> 00:32:01,423
collection item so that it could have
the specific information associated with

548
00:32:01,729 --> 00:32:01,820
that

549
00:32:02,639 --> 00:32:06,100
that the item will go ahead in on a view
controller that will then be able to

550
00:32:06,001 --> 00:32:07,540
leave we load the view

551
00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:10,641
if you're familiar with Isleworth this
is a little different than Iowa

552
00:32:10,659 --> 00:32:14,672
where I was you have to have a special
type love you control a subclass that

553
00:32:14,789 --> 00:32:15,840
they may or may not also own

554
00:32:16,299 --> 00:32:19,336
a special type item with inverted that
on

555
00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:24,683
horse tenure seventy and 01 the reasons
is that now your child view controllers

556
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:25,852
can be a lot more generic

557
00:32:26,239 --> 00:32:29,265
and the the pattern that we're using

558
00:32:29,499 --> 00:32:33,580
on Austin yosemite and the pattern we
suggest you follow as well

559
00:32:34,309 --> 00:32:37,327
there are some generic a container

560
00:32:37,489 --> 00:32:42,489
API with view controllers that are
expose that in a future level

561
00:32:42,489 --> 00:32:45,508
you can get an array of child view
controllers and add an Answer

562
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:48,714
remote job view controllers but these
API

563
00:32:49,029 --> 00:32:52,078
only manage the collection itself

564
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:55,528
it's up to you the subclass to know what
to do with them like to have you control

565
00:32:56,419 --> 00:32:57,444
will go ahead and create another

566
00:32:57,669 --> 00:33:01,340
tab but what show the views although the
views yet were split view controller

567
00:33:01,034 --> 00:33:03,563
will go ahead and Emilie added as
another split

568
00:33:03,869 --> 00:33:06,907
so it becomes important to do the right
thing

569
00:33:07,249 --> 00:33:12,249
in your subclass there but now with the
generic this dinner KPIs you can dig

570
00:33:12,249 --> 00:33:12,950
down in

571
00:33:12,095 --> 00:33:15,144
look at the chart view controllers
associated with a view controller

572
00:33:15,999 --> 00:33:20,100
or if you have a job you controller you
can go back up and find its parent

573
00:33:20,001 --> 00:33:24,080
and have a job you control you can just
call on it removed from para view

574
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:24,250
controller

575
00:33:24,889 --> 00:33:28,700
and that's the easiest way to a take
apart the

576
00:33:28,007 --> 00:33:32,007
parent-child relationship there

577
00:33:32,007 --> 00:33:35,956
adieu control we have and this message
in addition from you control to view

578
00:33:36,649 --> 00:33:36,724
controller

579
00:33:37,399 --> 00:33:40,850
which will do a nice enemy to transition
on your behalf this is what

580
00:33:40,085 --> 00:33:44,464
we have with view controller so it's the
exact same options you can do non with

581
00:33:45,229 --> 00:33:45,305
the crossfade

582
00:33:45,989 --> 00:33:49,570
or slide in various directions

583
00:33:49,057 --> 00:33:54,406
and that containment view controllers

584
00:33:54,919 --> 00:33:58,840
there's another type relationship with
view controllers and storyboards

585
00:33:58,084 --> 00:34:02,543
are called triggered segways

586
00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:06,375
Stricker said ways performer
presentation

587
00:34:07,059 --> 00:34:10,730
in a presentation if they haven't
identifiers so we can find it in the

588
00:34:10,073 --> 00:34:12,702
storyboard if needed manually

589
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:16,520
missed at some stores view controller
for example the

590
00:34:16,052 --> 00:34:19,119
campus view controller in this case is
our source to do our shit picker

591
00:34:20,019 --> 00:34:25,428
pop-up a destination controller which is
going to be a shape picker controller

592
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:28,604
and then a file and that we did a demo

593
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:32,780
the Segway star was a popover and a

594
00:34:32,078 --> 00:34:35,096
in this was the Segway depending on the
style there might be some other

595
00:34:35,096 --> 00:34:36,815
attributes need to set up

596
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,696
for example with the popover you need to
set up the acre view

597
00:34:40,849 --> 00:34:43,947
that we've had dragged it directly from
the plus button a curfew was white up

598
00:34:44,829 --> 00:34:44,910
automatically

599
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:49,692
but you can actually go in IB and set
the interview for the popover

600
00:34:50,169 --> 00:34:53,174
as my pointed out 11 a code that you
really need to write

601
00:34:53,669 --> 00:34:56,694
in the source view controller so in this
case our campus view controller

602
00:34:56,919 --> 00:35:01,190
endorsers you controller you need a over
I prepare for Segway

603
00:35:01,019 --> 00:35:04,418
from the said where you can get the
identifiers so if you have to deal with

604
00:35:04,589 --> 00:35:05,210
more than one

605
00:35:05,021 --> 00:35:08,119
said where you can switch on that get
the definition controller

606
00:35:09,019 --> 00:35:12,094
and wire up anything that needs to be
wired up so that you can have the proper

607
00:35:12,094 --> 00:35:13,176
lines of communication are you can get

608
00:35:14,076 --> 00:35:17,174
the right model data objects and show
the UI with the correct

609
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:21,125
information often this is the
represented controller

610
00:35:22,025 --> 00:35:25,047
the represented object and you can just
said the definition controller that

611
00:35:25,047 --> 00:35:28,140
represented object to the right thing

612
00:35:29,004 --> 00:35:33,893
there are a couple of additional segue
API's that you might find useful

613
00:35:34,289 --> 00:35:37,630
should perform several with identifiers
center this will

614
00:35:37,063 --> 00:35:40,732
give you a a a chance the step in a
dynamically

615
00:35:41,299 --> 00:35:45,030
prevent a segue from performing if you
need to determine that pretty late

616
00:35:45,003 --> 00:35:48,542
and if you determine that here we will
stop the segue from really getting off

617
00:35:48,569 --> 00:35:51,200
the ground

618
00:35:51,002 --> 00:35:55,601
that you can call perform said way with
identify our identifiers sender

619
00:35:55,799 --> 00:35:59,450
and we will find the Segway in the
storyboard for you

620
00:35:59,045 --> 00:36:02,714
and call perform which will flowback

621
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,162
through shipper forms over with
identifiers of course call prepare

622
00:36:06,549 --> 00:36:10,598
for Segway any to wire up the
represented object

623
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:14,068
you get nothing else on this whole
talked and I today

624
00:36:14,329 --> 00:36:18,510
arm its with your Segway you need to
implement prepare for Segway

625
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:22,140
in the source controller wire up you
represented object or whatever

626
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:26,680
pieces of information that you need to
bridge the bridge between the two

627
00:36:26,068 --> 00:36:29,073
animate the Segway happen

628
00:36:29,073 --> 00:36:33,082
using Interface Builder to wire up your
segways and do it all visually the

629
00:36:34,063 --> 00:36:37,068
the easiest way to go with our
recommended approach

630
00:36:37,068 --> 00:36:40,069
what we could take apart the engine a
little bit more time to look at the the

631
00:36:40,069 --> 00:36:40,128
manual

632
00:36:41,028 --> 00:36:44,107
API that's going on under the hood that
you can also call directly so we're

633
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:46,990
going ahead and we're exposing this API

634
00:36:46,099 --> 00:36:49,658
you cannot go source view controller to
present some other controller

635
00:36:50,549 --> 00:36:55,170
she at the modal window are the popover

636
00:36:55,017 --> 00:36:58,053
and after definition controller the the

637
00:36:58,053 --> 00:37:02,088
she'd or the model window the control
that is being presented

638
00:37:02,088 --> 00:37:06,027
you dismiss yourself by calling dismiss
controller and

639
00:37:06,819 --> 00:37:10,170
at get will do whatever the appropriate
thing to do the area's

640
00:37:10,017 --> 00:37:13,051
n dismiss the controller for you this is

641
00:37:13,051 --> 00:37:16,620
incredibly powerful because it allows
your definition controllers

642
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:22,100
to be a lot more modular and reusable
for example

643
00:37:22,289 --> 00:37:26,250
when I can our first during the summer
project can I view

644
00:37:26,025 --> 00:37:29,051
was like oh you know sheets the first
thing in there would you have our pic to

645
00:37:29,051 --> 00:37:30,089
come down as she

646
00:37:30,089 --> 00:37:33,100
and we were to present view controller
ashey

647
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,089
an up that was easy

648
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:41,160
that we said no no to a greater good
look much nicer the pop over to be Korea

649
00:37:41,799 --> 00:37:45,802
so the only thing we had the change was
the set with type 2 presented as

650
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:49,197
a popover our definition controller just
cause dismiss controller

651
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:53,940
didn't need to know how to dismiss a
popover or that

652
00:37:53,094 --> 00:37:56,191
dismissing a she in raw code is actually
dramatically different

653
00:37:57,091 --> 00:38:00,520
just go ahead and let in its view
controller handle that on your behalf

654
00:38:01,339 --> 00:38:05,416
and we'll do the appropriate thing

655
00:38:06,109 --> 00:38:09,153
we can actually go to yet one more level
deeper

656
00:38:09,549 --> 00:38:13,190
and there's at the lowest level present
view controller

657
00:38:13,019 --> 00:38:17,097
animator and your is a view controller
presentation animator protocol

658
00:38:17,097 --> 00:38:20,676
and where publishing this is well in
Yosemite

659
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:25,556
so you can create your own presentation
animator object implement the protocol

660
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:27,490
which is just these two methods

661
00:38:27,049 --> 00:38:30,178
Adam a presentation a view controller
front view controller

662
00:38:30,619 --> 00:38:35,030
so our when you do a presentation will
take the instanceof

663
00:38:35,003 --> 00:38:38,046
your animator object call animate
presentation a view controller from view

664
00:38:38,046 --> 00:38:38,122
controller

665
00:38:39,022 --> 00:38:42,100
and you can help the animation however
you want

666
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,002
what the users finished and dismissed
controllers called the quill

667
00:38:47,002 --> 00:38:50,007
bubble up to the right place we will
take that say missus that we had before

668
00:38:50,052 --> 00:38:51,321
we stashed it

669
00:38:51,789 --> 00:38:55,440
will call animate dismissal animate
dismiss love you controller from U

670
00:38:55,044 --> 00:38:55,052
controller

671
00:38:56,024 --> 00:38:59,122
you now responsible for doing any
dismissal animation however you see fit

672
00:39:00,022 --> 00:39:04,161
and what's that we what return from that
we will go ahead and released

673
00:39:04,359 --> 00:39:09,230
the animator object

674
00:39:09,023 --> 00:39:12,362
that new controllers there's a lot to do
with your view controllers is

675
00:39:12,569 --> 00:39:16,770
really powerful 0 you can't wait to see
what you're going to do with it

676
00:39:16,077 --> 00:39:20,896
it's gonna be a lot of fun but not for
talk about 10 control is a little bit

677
00:39:21,589 --> 00:39:25,670
and how they fit in with this a large
collection operator

678
00:39:25,067 --> 00:39:28,163
you control is that we're going to be
adding to our applications

679
00:39:29,063 --> 00:39:32,068
let's just look at some other new API we
have a window controller there's just a

680
00:39:32,068 --> 00:39:33,089
little bit

681
00:39:33,089 --> 00:39:38,068
namely there the car to view controller
miss the requirement

682
00:39:38,869 --> 00:39:42,000
in when you are in a few storyboard you
need to set up a cut the view controller

683
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,119
to your window controller

684
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:49,200
in its window also has a car to view
controller property that's new audit

685
00:39:49,002 --> 00:39:52,141
and what happens is when window
controller Lesley loads the window

686
00:39:52,339 --> 00:39:55,250
it sets the windows cut the view
controller to be there cut a view

687
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:56,334
controller

688
00:39:56,559 --> 00:39:59,630
that the 12 controller hath associated
with

689
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:02,088
scoresheet let you control you can also
get the story board that voted the

690
00:40:02,088 --> 00:40:04,126
winner controller if one or the window
controller

691
00:40:05,026 --> 00:40:09,095
Oro will return oh if you want a
controller was loaded from a storyboard

692
00:40:09,095 --> 00:40:12,103
and of course 10 controllers like view
controllers

693
00:40:13,003 --> 00:40:16,312
can be presented and you can call
dismiss controller on the window

694
00:40:16,339 --> 00:40:16,415
controller

695
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:21,125
and the right dismissal will happen

696
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:24,432
it has won a controller also implements
the Segway protocol

697
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:28,183
so that the you can prepare for Segway

698
00:40:29,029 --> 00:40:33,210
you can override that you can ask it to
perform so well with identify our

699
00:40:33,021 --> 00:40:37,026
and you can toss course over I should
perform segue to do dynamic

700
00:40:37,026 --> 00:40:43,105
a suppression and rare instances

701
00:40:43,339 --> 00:40:46,760
what really does a window controller
responsible for now

702
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:49,144
cuz we have the view controllers and all
your logic loving way down a view

703
00:40:50,044 --> 00:40:51,049
controller so

704
00:40:51,049 --> 00:40:54,065
you into control should just manage the
window you know things like

705
00:40:54,065 --> 00:40:57,123
should I really close on the close
button was pressed man as the title bar

706
00:40:58,023 --> 00:40:59,066
in the toolbar make sure that

707
00:40:59,066 --> 00:41:02,097
have the appropriate look there

708
00:41:02,097 --> 00:41:05,118
manage the content view controller have
a cut in the window

709
00:41:06,018 --> 00:41:10,074
10 controls gonna hit go ahead and
manage that

710
00:41:10,074 --> 00:41:14,076
10 controllers over time has been has
become a place where

711
00:41:14,076 --> 00:41:17,092
you put a lot of view logic I'm it was a

712
00:41:17,092 --> 00:41:21,096
giving a place to put your logic that a
for various parts of your

713
00:41:21,096 --> 00:41:25,165
user interface but now that we have you
controllers and a specified

714
00:41:26,065 --> 00:41:29,264
parent-child relationship in a hierarchy
here with segways

715
00:41:29,849 --> 00:41:33,250
you can move all that unrelated logic

716
00:41:33,025 --> 00:41:36,027
down to their appropriate view
controllers and now you have

717
00:41:36,027 --> 00:41:39,336
few controllers which are reusable
modules and

718
00:41:39,579 --> 00:41:43,650
they're more cohesive independent
modules and you don't have

719
00:41:43,065 --> 00:41:47,069
a unrelated code and you when you could
tell that you don't need anymore

720
00:41:47,069 --> 00:41:52,908
she went to Tylers a lot smaller and as
a lot more readable and maintainable

721
00:41:53,529 --> 00:41:58,180
that's 10 controllers let's talk a
little bit about gesture recognizers

722
00:41:58,018 --> 00:42:01,026
I'm really excited about us to recognize

723
00:42:01,026 --> 00:42:04,315
I'm in a bit guy at heart so like perot

724
00:42:04,549 --> 00:42:09,200
thats so what you do things just
recognize the store them

725
00:42:09,002 --> 00:42:12,002
yosemite they are the API's

726
00:42:12,002 --> 00:42:16,391
nearly identical to it to what it is on
Iowa

727
00:42:16,589 --> 00:42:19,740
there lotta fun

728
00:42:19,074 --> 00:42:23,126
but when you're looking at on the
desktop motion gestures

729
00:42:24,026 --> 00:42:27,049
are determined the same way that they
are on i OS on I what you have to look

730
00:42:27,049 --> 00:42:29,668
at the raw touches and figure out what
that means

731
00:42:30,109 --> 00:42:33,390
if you do a pinch gesture on the
trackpad on Austin

732
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:36,498
the trackpad itself recognizes that as a
magnification

733
00:42:36,849 --> 00:42:41,500
and it sends magnification events she
don't have to figure that out

734
00:42:41,005 --> 00:42:45,334
but not everything that we can recognize
as a gesture

735
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:49,200
is pre recognize force at the lower
levels

736
00:42:49,002 --> 00:42:52,033
for example what is a click

737
00:42:52,051 --> 00:42:56,350
you press on the trackpad which is gonna
emulate a mouse events good

738
00:42:56,809 --> 00:43:00,500
are you press them out but you get a
mouth down a bit followed by mouth up a

739
00:43:00,005 --> 00:43:01,100
bit without any drugs in between

740
00:43:02,045 --> 00:43:05,053
so this is some different events and we
can look at the mall

741
00:43:06,025 --> 00:43:09,644
together relies in combine them for you
go that a quick

742
00:43:09,869 --> 00:43:13,990
so we can recognize a quick we can
recognize that independently as

743
00:43:13,099 --> 00:43:16,174
and differently than something that a
quick a dragon release

744
00:43:17,074 --> 00:43:22,119
that something else Janice it is just a
recognizers really good at helping you

745
00:43:23,019 --> 00:43:27,113
disambiguate user input how good well

746
00:43:28,013 --> 00:43:30,019
this is coded you might have had to
write a few had to figure it out

747
00:43:30,073 --> 00:43:30,151
yourself

748
00:43:31,051 --> 00:43:34,099
7 my 7

749
00:43:34,099 --> 00:43:37,176
tracking loops deep above nectar that
match in math

750
00:43:38,076 --> 00:43:41,355
and with the code is trying to do is
figure out

751
00:43:42,039 --> 00:43:46,020
is this a click I double click a triple
click or a dragon is trying to sort all

752
00:43:46,002 --> 00:43:49,067
this out no large that's associated with

753
00:43:49,067 --> 00:43:53,196
just recognizes clean this all up make
it are much more simpler to disambiguate

754
00:43:53,799 --> 00:43:54,980
user input

755
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:57,727
gives you folks to tap into there when
you need to add some custom logic

756
00:43:58,609 --> 00:44:03,200
and it's much easier to maintain

757
00:44:03,002 --> 00:44:07,411
just recognizes are really good fit for
view controllers

758
00:44:07,609 --> 00:44:10,910
you really don't wanna have to override
mousedown in your view controller that

759
00:44:10,091 --> 00:44:12,460
much shopping your view controller
should really be

760
00:44:13,279 --> 00:44:16,640
doing in when you go to Rieger code in
your view controller you gonna see

761
00:44:16,064 --> 00:44:19,068
meltdown and you have to try and figure
out with comments are by

762
00:44:19,068 --> 00:44:23,457
really looking at the cold what is this
meltdown trying to do

763
00:44:24,069 --> 00:44:27,920
you controllers have a target action
pair we will recognize the four click on

764
00:44:27,092 --> 00:44:30,101
the four track for you and now you can
wear that up to an action in your view

765
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:31,077
controller

766
00:44:31,077 --> 00:44:34,090
just having mousedown you have select

767
00:44:34,009 --> 00:44:39,020
are you have drag and it's now obvious
in your code it's much more readable on

768
00:44:40,001 --> 00:44:40,100
what to do

769
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,099
and is partitioned out better much more
maintainable Co

770
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:48,164
here's an example love using just
recognize is in place with code

771
00:44:49,064 --> 00:44:53,076
this is Alexa knitting a modification
gesture recognizer you hit the target in

772
00:44:53,076 --> 00:44:54,095
the action

773
00:44:54,779 --> 00:44:57,834
or point out a slight difference here
from Iowa

774
00:44:58,329 --> 00:45:02,378
on North 10 all of our controls in our
menus have a single target action pair

775
00:45:02,819 --> 00:45:05,500
that the paradigm we use that the
paradigm we're continuing to use within

776
00:45:05,005 --> 00:45:06,048
its just a recognizer

777
00:45:06,093 --> 00:45:10,114
that's a little bit different than I owe
us what you have just a recognizer

778
00:45:11,014 --> 00:45:14,069
a Alexa knitted you go ahead an upset

779
00:45:14,069 --> 00:45:17,120
on some view just recognizes need to be
attached to a viewing recognized for

780
00:45:18,002 --> 00:45:18,027
that

781
00:45:18,044 --> 00:45:21,116
you optionally you may need to fit the
delegate

782
00:45:22,016 --> 00:45:25,047
you just a recognizer to your view
controller perhaps you to set up some

783
00:45:25,047 --> 00:45:28,616
more logic to help disambiguation things

784
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:32,071
then your poem attraction method mean
magnify in this case

785
00:45:32,359 --> 00:45:35,520
the center of the action method is gonna
be the gesture recognizer

786
00:45:35,052 --> 00:45:38,074
you probably wanna switch of the state

787
00:45:38,074 --> 00:45:42,373
so you can for a magnified you look at
it started it began you set up some

788
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:44,043
initial state

789
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:47,490
you do you magnification during the
changes and when it finally

790
00:45:47,049 --> 00:45:50,123
in you go ahead you commit your changes
to your

791
00:45:51,023 --> 00:45:54,100
your data model that way with this
commit when you do and do you just get

792
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,359
one on do instead of just

793
00:45:56,359 --> 00:45:59,990
part the magnification something like a
quick

794
00:45:59,099 --> 00:46:02,638
there is another state which is Rick
just recognize

795
00:46:03,529 --> 00:46:06,670
soft there's not a recognized that goes
to begin change ended

796
00:46:06,067 --> 00:46:09,746
because it's just a single a collection
like a quick

797
00:46:10,349 --> 00:46:14,770
your just check the recognized state

798
00:46:14,077 --> 00:46:17,126
just recognize that we're exposing in
Yosemite

799
00:46:17,819 --> 00:46:22,640
are the click gesture recognizer this is
a mouse down and up you could set which

800
00:46:22,064 --> 00:46:23,263
button

801
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:26,900
to recognize or even korda buttons to
recognize

802
00:46:26,009 --> 00:46:29,041
there's the pair just a recognizer which
is

803
00:46:30,022 --> 00:46:33,050
a mouse button down drag and release

804
00:46:33,005 --> 00:46:36,027
and a this is very similar to

805
00:46:36,072 --> 00:46:39,151
depend just a recognizer on iowa's but I
West take touch

806
00:46:40,051 --> 00:46:44,068
moving release an equivalent of that on
the desktop is obviously the mouse

807
00:46:44,068 --> 00:46:48,069
knocked down move release and if I could
just recognize that you can set

808
00:46:48,069 --> 00:46:52,178
which button to recognize or Core two
buttons

809
00:46:52,799 --> 00:46:56,730
there's a press just a recognizer which
is our holding off button down

810
00:46:56,073 --> 00:47:00,952
with the time component so up a long
press is another way that we set about

811
00:47:01,609 --> 00:47:06,420
and in a press just organizer cook with
the time component

812
00:47:06,042 --> 00:47:09,711
that we have magnification gesture
recognizer and rotation just recognizer

813
00:47:10,089 --> 00:47:14,660
I mentioned earlier that magnification
in rotation are already recognized for

814
00:47:14,066 --> 00:47:17,072
us in at the hardware level and that's
true

815
00:47:18,026 --> 00:47:22,043
but they can still be bundled up in
federal gesture recognizer so that you

816
00:47:22,043 --> 00:47:22,722
can

817
00:47:23,109 --> 00:47:27,130
get this nice arm target action

818
00:47:27,013 --> 00:47:30,018
association with it and it continues to
fit in

819
00:47:30,063 --> 00:47:33,063
the model with these other gesture
recognizers in your application so you

820
00:47:33,063 --> 00:47:34,097
have a consistent use

821
00:47:34,097 --> 00:47:38,416
I love gestures inside wrap and of
course you can also set

822
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:42,317
the medication rotation Justin
recognizers to

823
00:47:42,569 --> 00:47:46,190
work at the same time simultaneously or
you can have them

824
00:47:46,019 --> 00:47:49,928
where no I only want to recognize
magnifications our rotations one at a

825
00:47:50,099 --> 00:47:50,910
time

826
00:47:50,091 --> 00:47:54,480
so you can why those up with you various
properties

827
00:47:55,299 --> 00:47:59,450
arm I do wanna make one quick aside on
magnification rotation

828
00:47:59,045 --> 00:48:02,138
gestures the raw ovett the magnification
rotation events

829
00:48:03,038 --> 00:48:07,072
we've had the phase property to those
events so the event also have

830
00:48:07,072 --> 00:48:11,451
began a changed in ended phase is
associated with them so you can

831
00:48:12,099 --> 00:48:15,142
if you're looking at the wrong events
you can determine their faces right

832
00:48:15,529 --> 00:48:17,537
there

833
00:48:17,609 --> 00:48:20,760
the flow is really important with
gesture recognizers

834
00:48:20,076 --> 00:48:24,093
um with looking out for us first about
press for an example

835
00:48:24,093 --> 00:48:27,962
and maverick's would work like this of
press goes through and its applications

836
00:48:28,799 --> 00:48:28,875
and events

837
00:48:29,559 --> 00:48:32,634
if it doesn't get consumed their said if
it will send it off to the event

838
00:48:33,309 --> 00:48:33,364
observers

839
00:48:33,859 --> 00:48:36,908
if there are any if they've been
observers don't consume it it will flow

840
00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:38,200
back up

841
00:48:38,002 --> 00:48:42,055
to have sent a bit incentive it will
send off to the appropriate window

842
00:48:42,073 --> 00:48:45,149
that windows in a bit method is called
the book to the event figures out

843
00:48:46,049 --> 00:48:50,608
be a hit testing which view the Senate
to that you get a meltdown message

844
00:48:51,049 --> 00:48:54,052
at the mouth if the view doesn't consume
the most down

845
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:57,148
it but was up to the responder chain as
normal and whereas

846
00:48:57,769 --> 00:49:01,130
normal now and maverick's in a use an
excuse me

847
00:49:01,013 --> 00:49:04,202
includes your view controllers

848
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:07,342
just recognizers are here there

849
00:49:07,549 --> 00:49:11,556
what the Venice in through the window in
when in this one does send a bit

850
00:49:11,619 --> 00:49:14,663
it will do the gesture recognizing you
might notice we have some dashed arrows

851
00:49:15,059 --> 00:49:16,950
now is that a solid arrows

852
00:49:16,095 --> 00:49:19,166
reason for that is just recognizers
might delay a bit

853
00:49:20,066 --> 00:49:24,140
just recognizes will take a pan for
example which is a drag

854
00:49:25,004 --> 00:49:29,153
you'll do a meltdown occurs will not
sure if they're dragging yet or not we

855
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:31,571
don't want any every other code to

856
00:49:31,769 --> 00:49:35,774
start trying to go into a tracking loop
or do anything with the down yet we want

857
00:49:35,819 --> 00:49:38,470
to wait till we know for sure if it's a
drag or not

858
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:41,064
and so you just recognizes can delay a
bit

859
00:49:41,064 --> 00:49:44,117
if they into not consuming them then
they will continue to flow through the

860
00:49:45,017 --> 00:49:47,676
system as normal

861
00:49:47,829 --> 00:49:49,881
what's really important for you to
understand as developers here

862
00:49:50,349 --> 00:49:51,760
centerville is a place that

863
00:49:51,076 --> 00:49:55,148
as often overridden if you do over
rights and evident in its application or

864
00:49:56,048 --> 00:49:56,143
in its window

865
00:49:57,043 --> 00:50:00,051
if you consume events that just
recognizes have already started the

866
00:50:00,051 --> 00:50:00,117
process

867
00:50:01,017 --> 00:50:04,906
in that sequence you can really confuse
a gesture recognizer

868
00:50:05,059 --> 00:50:08,140
and then you're out will not work right
at all

869
00:50:08,014 --> 00:50:10,913
so you need to be careful about that and
think about that when you're using

870
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:12,220
gesture recognizers

871
00:50:12,022 --> 00:50:15,361
this also goes for even observers if you
hadn't been observer

872
00:50:15,559 --> 00:50:18,587
you can consume the events before the
gesture recognizer gets to them and they

873
00:50:18,839 --> 00:50:19,936
just recognize a really needs to you

874
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:25,720
have all of them that belong in a
sequence together

875
00:50:25,072 --> 00:50:28,115
if you're so close gesture recognizer
you can we fully support that check out

876
00:50:29,015 --> 00:50:29,051
the

877
00:50:29,051 --> 00:50:33,080
in its just a recognized its file
there's in in a subclass

878
00:50:33,539 --> 00:50:37,547
use category this is where we've put a
category for the additional methods

879
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:40,650
that so classes need to work worry about

880
00:50:40,065 --> 00:50:44,534
and you can write a subclass and
recognize the drug will call as

881
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,180
whatever you want to recognize it to be

882
00:50:48,018 --> 00:50:51,099
I never got the details here so if you
want more information please come see me

883
00:50:51,099 --> 00:50:51,168
or the lab

884
00:50:52,068 --> 00:50:58,467
and I will be more than happy to talk to
you about just recognize

885
00:50:59,079 --> 00:51:02,460
so let's put this all together a little
bit and let's go back to our demo

886
00:51:02,046 --> 00:51:05,049
an let's get that chick to move

887
00:51:05,076 --> 00:51:09,425
my could get the pic to move but I think
I can

888
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:14,390
okay so will run this again real quick

889
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:18,018
make sure we're all right back in the
same spot they were we were

890
00:51:18,369 --> 00:51:23,510
we've added a shape and sure enough we
can't get it to move

891
00:51:23,051 --> 00:51:26,130
well

892
00:51:26,589 --> 00:51:33,589
I know

893
00:51:34,046 --> 00:51:37,098
and then the camera's view controller I
wrote I select

894
00:51:37,098 --> 00:51:41,177
action method here to drag with gesture
recognizer action method here

895
00:51:42,059 --> 00:51:45,135
from so I know that this stuff exist

896
00:51:45,819 --> 00:51:48,822
should be getting call so we need to
figure out whether not getting called

897
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:52,193
and it so you know just like a show
before you just switch on the state and

898
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:53,925
you do what you need to do there

899
00:51:54,519 --> 00:51:58,940
so let's go back into our story board

900
00:51:58,094 --> 00:52:01,123
and look at our campus view controller

901
00:52:02,023 --> 00:52:02,095
and

902
00:52:02,095 --> 00:52:06,171
and became YouTube my just a recognizes
out there so let's go ahead and add some

903
00:52:07,071 --> 00:52:10,122
will quickly at a pen gesture recognizer

904
00:52:11,022 --> 00:52:14,070
and will why the pair just a recognizer

905
00:52:14,007 --> 00:52:17,666
up to the track and we'll go ahead in

906
00:52:18,359 --> 00:52:22,430
magnified by gesture recognizer

907
00:52:22,043 --> 00:52:27,056
ago there we are

908
00:52:27,056 --> 00:52:31,057
well that and wire that up to

909
00:52:31,066 --> 00:52:34,140
magnify now should be quite

910
00:52:35,004 --> 00:52:39,086
obvious what code is going to get ron
runner-up

911
00:52:40,022 --> 00:52:44,039
attache and

912
00:52:44,039 --> 00:52:47,104
now we can drag and we can do a pinch
and resize the shape

913
00:52:48,004 --> 00:52:51,101
any we can add another one and they work
independently of each other

914
00:52:52,001 --> 00:52:59,001
an there we go view controllers

915
00:53:04,002 --> 00:53:07,401
backing storyboards

916
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:11,647
superheated design applications now 10
controllers

917
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:15,180
just control your window but they also
have some nice

918
00:53:15,018 --> 00:53:18,089
a new API to work with storyboards wire

919
00:53:18,089 --> 00:53:21,168
up your a gestures with gesture
recognizers

920
00:53:22,068 --> 00:53:25,076
it easier than ever it's a lot of fun
everything here

921
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:28,088

documentation we r

927
00:53:46,066 --> 00:53:51,475
working like crazy on the documentation
for view controller so that is going to

928
00:53:52,069 --> 00:53:52,770
be coming

929
00:53:52,077 --> 00:53:56,896

i really wanna point out creating Monaco
collapse on Thursday

933
00:54:05,049 --> 00:54:08,408
if you're just new to writing absent Mac
OS 10

934
00:54:08,849 --> 00:54:11,873
Monaco collapse will cover view
controllers a little bit but their cover

935
00:54:12,089 --> 00:54:15,680
another a lot of other technologies that
you should be also implementing in your

936
00:54:15,068 --> 00:54:15,757
application

937
00:54:16,369 --> 00:54:21,300
