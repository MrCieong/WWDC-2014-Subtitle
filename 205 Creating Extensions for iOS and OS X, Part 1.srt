1
00:00:20,078 --> 00:00:21,140
hello

2
00:00:22,004 --> 00:00:24,081
I'm Ian Baird I was frameworks engineer

3
00:00:25,017 --> 00:00:28,136
and today I'm here to tell you about
creating extensions

4
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:33,720
for Iowa's and OS 10 gonna lay out a
quick agenda for today's stock

5
00:00:33,072 --> 00:00:36,114
first we're going to talk about
extensions an extension points

6
00:00:37,014 --> 00:00:40,080
then I'm going to invite my colleague
Matt Campbell

7
00:00:40,008 --> 00:00:44,014
from the Notification Center team to the
stage to tell you more

8
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:49,087
and show you more about creating one of
the hottest new tickets at BBC 14

9
00:00:49,096 --> 00:00:54,105
today extensions

10
00:00:55,086 --> 00:00:58,089
and then following on from that we're
going to invite

11
00:00:58,089 --> 00:01:01,188
our colleague I forton onto the stage

12
00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:04,989
to tell you more about how to create
share extensions

13
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:08,060
like the one you saw in the keynote with
Pinterest

14
00:01:08,006 --> 00:01:11,855
moving on

15
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:15,640
water extensions well extensions

16
00:01:15,064 --> 00:01:18,142
are almost like it's a way for you

17
00:01:19,042 --> 00:01:23,113
to extend the system and other
applications

18
00:01:24,013 --> 00:01:27,031
it's almost like more surface area for
you to be able to apply

19
00:01:27,031 --> 00:01:30,510
bits and pieces have your app as you can
see here

20
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:34,570
we have a screenshot at the Apple
homepage on an iPad

21
00:01:34,057 --> 00:01:37,060
showing the new activity view controller

22
00:01:37,006 --> 00:01:40,092
you'll notice a lot of familiar faces a
lot of familiar icons

23
00:01:41,046 --> 00:01:44,070
in that activity view controller you can
see messages male

24
00:01:44,007 --> 00:01:47,014
and we have a new one the butterfly

25
00:01:47,077 --> 00:01:50,120
and butterflies sharing extension you
can see it at home

26
00:01:51,002 --> 00:01:54,040
right there with its brother in right in
the midst

27
00:01:54,058 --> 00:02:00,217
at the sharing extensions and we also
support sharing extensions on LSN

28
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:04,170
in see we have the butterfly sherry
extension on Yosemite

29
00:02:04,017 --> 00:02:08,696
we support Notification Center
extensions

30
00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:12,750
also known as today extensions and as
you can see

31
00:02:12,075 --> 00:02:15,133
notification extensions are really good
forgiving you

32
00:02:16,033 --> 00:02:19,105
at a glance information something where
you just wanna pull your phone

33
00:02:20,005 --> 00:02:23,092
out your pocket take a quick look checks
in sports scores

34
00:02:23,092 --> 00:02:26,187
may be traffic conditions the weather
and put it back in your pocket

35
00:02:27,087 --> 00:02:31,128
gives you at a glance quick access to
information you want

36
00:02:32,028 --> 00:02:35,080
and of course we support this on your
seventy

37
00:02:35,008 --> 00:02:39,057
and you can see it looks gorgeous
blended right over that new background

38
00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:42,860
is just beautiful stunningly beautiful
team did a great job

39
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,290
next

40
00:02:46,029 --> 00:02:50,050
I want to show you the custom action
extensions you can see here

41
00:02:50,005 --> 00:02:53,010
we have our new annotate image extension
which I'm gonna show you how to build

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,629
tomorrow

43
00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:58,250
right in that role with actions actions
can be

44
00:02:58,025 --> 00:03:01,119
you I in nine you I actions as you saw
with the Bing translate extension

45
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:06,076
and we support custom actions on the
west end as well as a matter fact this

46
00:03:06,076 --> 00:03:06,108
is

47
00:03:07,008 --> 00:03:10,057
the infrastructure for the markup
extension

48
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:13,109
on a west and you'll notice is a very
common theme

49
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:17,065
we're sharing infrastructure we're
making it easy for you to build things

50
00:03:17,065 --> 00:03:18,119
for both platforms

51
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:22,102
next on Iowa s only

52
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:26,046
we have the I the photo extensions now

53
00:03:26,046 --> 00:03:29,046
if there's a photo filter that you've
been missing

54
00:03:29,046 --> 00:03:33,047
I don't know maybe arm or an annotation

55
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:36,113
extension you would like to make for
photos you can build it now

56
00:03:37,013 --> 00:03:42,110
right into the photos you why this is
really cool we also support

57
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:46,013
document providers document providers
bring

58
00:03:46,022 --> 00:03:50,079
storage and things like that from the
cloud writing and applications

59
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:53,154
incited by a last this is our first it
really breaks down a lot of barriers

60
00:03:54,054 --> 00:03:55,145
that we've all been living with for

61
00:03:56,045 --> 00:04:03,045
a I believe 7 releases and next I want
to tell you about a finder extensions

62
00:04:03,068 --> 00:04:06,145
finder extensions are really cool in the
past if you wanted to be able to bad

63
00:04:07,045 --> 00:04:07,048
sure

64
00:04:07,075 --> 00:04:10,091
annotate items and folders inside the
Finder

65
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:13,140
you may have to resort to super sketchy
behavior

66
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:17,027
like mocking jay act or or some sort of
hackery

67
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:20,705
and now you don't have to do that now
you actually have a supported way

68
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:24,336
to daj items in the Finder and we think
this is really cool

69
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:28,694
and then

70
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:31,970
the last but not least third-party
keyboards

71
00:04:31,097 --> 00:04:34,606
were supporting third-party keyboards in
I'll ask now

72
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:42,330
using extensions so I told you about
extensions and some the extension point

73
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:43,122
so we're offering

74
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:48,520
NIOS and a West and next I'd like to
tell you about delivering extensions

75
00:04:48,052 --> 00:04:51,083
extensions are delivered as part of your
up known as

76
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:54,116
the extension container an extension
container

77
00:04:55,016 --> 00:04:58,063
petain many different types extensions

78
00:04:58,063 --> 00:05:01,111
for example it could contain today view
which it

79
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:06,014
it contain sharing extension and it
could also contain

80
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:09,065
maybe multiple custom action extensions

81
00:05:09,065 --> 00:05:12,194
they're all bound up with in your
applications bundle

82
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:16,770
and delivered via the App Store

83
00:05:16,077 --> 00:05:20,116
extension points wife talked a little
bit but dow extension points earlier

84
00:05:20,809 --> 00:05:23,853
well tell tell you what they are
extension points again are the new

85
00:05:24,249 --> 00:05:27,306
bits and pieces have surface area that
we've exposed on the system

86
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:31,150
for your extensions to bind to you for
example

87
00:05:31,015 --> 00:05:34,083
a today view widget binds to the
Notification Center

88
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,352
via the Notification Center extension 30
today view

89
00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:41,136
extension point this means you're never
going to see

90
00:05:41,469 --> 00:05:46,544
it. debut extension any activity view
controller for example

91
00:05:47,219 --> 00:05:51,050
and one thing to remember about all
extensions is that their purpose

92
00:05:51,005 --> 00:05:54,071
build binaries see these are not aP's
these are not even

93
00:05:54,071 --> 00:05:58,076
at apiece if your app it's not a special
mode that we launcher app and

94
00:05:59,021 --> 00:06:02,030
it's a special purpose binary it has its
own

95
00:06:02,219 --> 00:06:05,238
code signature has its own set of
entitlements

96
00:06:05,409 --> 00:06:09,413
and it has own container Damien's going
to speak to this further in tomorrow's

97
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:11,360
session

98
00:06:11,036 --> 00:06:14,145
so as I said they're not outs and
they're always

99
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:19,050
accessed via Apple frameworks code you
never really direct we launched an apple

100
00:06:19,005 --> 00:06:20,084
frameworks code

101
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:23,195
is in charge of discovering them for you
and providing usually the user

102
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:27,810
interaction by which their launch in all
talk about that later

103
00:06:27,999 --> 00:06:31,770
and as I was talking with the developer
at lunch about this right before we came

104
00:06:31,077 --> 00:06:32,161
here these are not facilitating

105
00:06:33,061 --> 00:06:36,300
app to app my PC you don't get like

106
00:06:36,849 --> 00:06:40,915
a pipe back to the containing out for
your extension be able to talk to it

107
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:45,512
if you want to build workflows that
incorporate apk app by PC you can still

108
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:46,610
use things like

109
00:06:46,061 --> 00:06:49,550
UI application open /url but

110
00:06:50,099 --> 00:06:53,193
what I would ask you to do is reconsider
some these workflows that you had before

111
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:55,064
that involved

112
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:58,386
sort of contextually switching from one
application to another on a user's phone

113
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:02,358
and reconsider casting this may be in
terms of custom actions which are really

114
00:07:03,249 --> 00:07:07,580
the spiritual successors to you services

115
00:07:07,058 --> 00:07:12,037
so next what our extension points a very
high level they mark extensible parts in

116
00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:13,564
the system

117
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:17,860
they're always packaged in system
frameworks we don't support

118
00:07:17,086 --> 00:07:20,605
third-party extension points and they
combine

119
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:25,383
API and policies you can imagine again
with the to debut aged

120
00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:29,437
the today be widget its it's very simple
it's largely is Matt's going to tell you

121
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,664
a view controller but this view
controller also comes with its own

122
00:07:33,249 --> 00:07:34,265
policy

123
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:38,110
policy which incorporates things like
launch characteristics

124
00:07:38,011 --> 00:07:42,052
an important thing to remember about
extensions most extensions on the system

125
00:07:42,052 --> 00:07:45,341
are bound 121 with our hosting ap

126
00:07:45,809 --> 00:07:50,110
so let me give you an example of this
what say you write a sharing extension

127
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:53,340
and the sharing extension is invoked in
Safari

128
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:57,330
instanceof your extension a new process
is going to be spun up

129
00:07:57,033 --> 00:08:00,058
to serve Safari now to use our homes out

130
00:08:00,058 --> 00:08:03,137
goes over to mail and large is your
extension again

131
00:08:03,659 --> 00:08:08,550
but say maybe to share an attachment a
brand new process is going to be spun up

132
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:12,374
four-year extension those processes are
not going to share address spaces

133
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:16,210
this protects you from mistakes your
code if you're still using Objective C

134
00:08:16,021 --> 00:08:18,510
in you have a while pointer or something
like that

135
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:21,740
you're not going to be able to bring
down all the instances have your

136
00:08:21,074 --> 00:08:21,983
extension

137
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:26,687
that are running on the system it's
really cool

138
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:30,093
the extension point also governs the
presentation have your extension

139
00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:34,140
important thing to remember is that you
extensions are you I view controllers

140
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,843
you can hear this multiple times today

141
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:39,760
but you are you controllers can be
expose the user in multiple ways

142
00:08:39,076 --> 00:08:43,285
and usually since extensions live inside
the applique inside the user interface

143
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:45,960
another application

144
00:08:45,096 --> 00:08:49,151
its up to that application up to the
system as to how it decides present you

145
00:08:50,051 --> 00:08:53,070
you can either be contained or presented

146
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:56,880
Notification Center widgets to debut
extensions

147
00:08:56,088 --> 00:09:01,110
are contained while sharing extensions
are presented

148
00:09:02,001 --> 00:09:06,004
and many extension points support for a
few extension point support

149
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:10,060
view controller and non view controller
variance at the extension point

150
00:09:10,006 --> 00:09:13,055
for instance custom actions as you'll
see tomorrow

151
00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:17,580
support a view controller variant which
allows the user to interact with the

152
00:09:17,058 --> 00:09:20,092
content before it's transformed and sent
back to the host

153
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:23,170
as you saw during the keynote when Craig
capped the Bing translate extension

154
00:09:24,007 --> 00:09:27,093
there was no UI and that was in non-fuel
extension and we'll tell you more about

155
00:09:28,056 --> 00:09:30,129
that later

156
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:34,074
cell how extensions and felt this is
again

157
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:37,079
going back to our example the show you
what happens

158
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:40,143
when user decides to tap on the
butterfly sharing extension

159
00:09:41,043 --> 00:09:46,043
user taps and the extension host which
is safari at this time

160
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:49,106
goes and talks to the Notification
Center framework

161
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:53,025
the notification sorry not notification
the social framework

162
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:56,112
and the social framework goes and
discovers and loads and presents the

163
00:09:57,012 --> 00:09:58,016
extension

164
00:09:58,016 --> 00:10:01,069
you'll notice that Safari is not
directly

165
00:10:01,069 --> 00:10:05,073
watching the extension at any point its
balancing through Apple frameworks to do

166
00:10:05,073 --> 00:10:06,742
this

167
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:12,430
so in summary extensions are small
pieces the functionality

168
00:10:12,043 --> 00:10:16,046
their purpose built to do one thing and
get out the way

169
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:19,110
they stand the system in New an
interesting ways

170
00:10:20,001 --> 00:10:24,001
we can't wait to see what you guys do
with these things

171
00:10:24,001 --> 00:10:28,032
and a mark extendable parse the system
as I said new surface area for you to

172
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,137
attach the functionality of your app

173
00:10:30,037 --> 00:10:33,100
interesting and meaningful ways for our
users

174
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,004
and now to tell you more about
Notification Center extensions

175
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:44,004
I'd like to invite my colleague not
gamble to the stage

176
00:10:47,003 --> 00:10:51,852
hello I'm at Campbell Newman engineer in
the I US notifications team

177
00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:55,162
and today I'm a tell you about
Notification Center extensions

178
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:00,290
widgets as we call them now we've had
widgets in some fashion on the

179
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:03,860
system for a while now but for the first
time

180
00:11:03,086 --> 00:11:07,086
you know I was 8 we're giving developers
the power to add their own content to

181
00:11:07,086 --> 00:11:11,545
the notification centers today view

182
00:11:12,319 --> 00:11:16,310
now perhaps most fundamentally widgets
are view controllers

183
00:11:16,031 --> 00:11:19,730
so that means everything you know about
you controllers including the life cycle

184
00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:22,000
in containment behavior in API

185
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,129
will serve you well when you're
constructing your widget

186
00:11:25,129 --> 00:11:28,230
for example the appearance calls these
I'll tell you when

187
00:11:28,023 --> 00:11:31,882
your widget is coming and going in the
Notification Center

188
00:11:32,089 --> 00:11:35,910
in a particular interest is you will
appear as you want to be sure that your

189
00:11:35,091 --> 00:11:35,750
view is

190
00:11:36,569 --> 00:11:39,626
up and ready to be used by the user by
the time you're returning from you will

191
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:41,178
appear

192
00:11:41,529 --> 00:11:45,558
so speedy have getting ready it's
important to get ready fast performance

193
00:11:45,819 --> 00:11:49,740
the very big consideration with
notification center widgets

194
00:11:49,074 --> 00:11:53,483
so couple tips are be sure to load cache
data so you're bringing up your view

195
00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:55,210
quickly and ready to go

196
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:01,190
and if you have some new data comes in
you can do your own custom transition

197
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:04,718
also kick off your expensive operations
as early as possible

198
00:12:04,889 --> 00:12:09,750
and definitely in the background and
when those expensive operations return

199
00:12:09,075 --> 00:12:13,284
be sure to cash this data

200
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:17,045
so layout is another concern are of
course your widgets in your

201
00:12:17,819 --> 00:12:22,850
your widget has control over its sub the
hierarchy in laying all your content out

202
00:12:23,129 --> 00:12:26,205
but just as with any other parent child
you control your relationship

203
00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:30,230
the Notification Center will be laying
out your views

204
00:12:30,023 --> 00:12:33,074
frame so that means that the
notification center is setting

205
00:12:33,074 --> 00:12:36,723
the frames you don't set your own widget
views frame

206
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:40,970
but of course not all content is created
equal so

207
00:12:40,097 --> 00:12:43,104
if you might have need some more room
for your content

208
00:12:44,067 --> 00:12:47,069
you can indicate your preferred height

209
00:12:47,087 --> 00:12:50,142
you do this in two ways the for sister
on a layup

210
00:12:51,042 --> 00:12:54,066
if you can are described your Widgets

211
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:57,162
height with constraints then those to be
honored automatically in Notification

212
00:12:58,062 --> 00:12:59,104
Center

213
00:13:00,004 --> 00:13:03,483
otherwise if you're using more manual
layout you can use the view controller

214
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,536
method Sep referred content size

215
00:13:06,689 --> 00:13:12,550
and both the systems work across both I
O S and OS 10

216
00:13:12,055 --> 00:13:16,081
so while you will definitely want to set
your size as early as possible to ensure

217
00:13:16,081 --> 00:13:17,960
that you're showing your content

218
00:13:18,689 --> 00:13:22,810
are him the right way in Notification
Center that's not the only time

219
00:13:22,081 --> 00:13:26,480
that you can call it if for some reason
you are showing different content or

220
00:13:27,209 --> 00:13:29,221
changes you can call this later

221
00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:32,373
for instance let's say that we had a
button that would show a little bit more

222
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:33,730
content

223
00:13:33,073 --> 00:13:36,130
are a little bit more detail about some
content that we have in our widget

224
00:13:37,003 --> 00:13:40,592
you could tie this up to this action
calculate the new height for this new

225
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:41,800
content

226
00:13:41,008 --> 00:13:45,237
and then just call Sep referred content
size the Notification Center

227
00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:49,083
will take care of this it'll
automatically resize your widget

228
00:13:49,569 --> 00:13:53,571
but that's only half the story which you
probably want to do is ensure

229
00:13:53,589 --> 00:13:56,595
that your content animates along with
this transition

230
00:13:57,189 --> 00:14:00,248
and you can do that on I Wes with the
new method

231
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:04,870
view will transition to size with
transition coordinator

232
00:14:04,087 --> 00:14:07,156
to if you're would implement this method
it'll get called

233
00:14:07,939 --> 00:14:11,965
and passed in a transition coordinator
and with this corner you can call

234
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:15,420
animate alongside transition passing in
your

235
00:14:15,042 --> 00:14:19,771
a block with your animations and easily
run in parallel with the system's

236
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:23,235
resize animation and again and then a
completion to know when everything's

237
00:14:24,009 --> 00:14:26,054
finished up

238
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:30,497
now there's a similar story on OS 10 in
this case its view will transition to

239
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:30,924
size

240
00:14:31,689 --> 00:14:34,720
again this will be called and you can
take advantage love

241
00:14:34,072 --> 00:14:37,931
and as animation contact to run your own
animation group

242
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:41,581
and again pass in a completion handler
see you know when everything's finished

243
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:43,853
up

244
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:47,550
now new IRS 8 is a protocol

245
00:14:47,055 --> 00:14:50,074
NC which it providing and one of the a

246
00:14:50,074 --> 00:14:53,161
optional map is this protocol is with
you perform update

247
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:57,066
with completion handler and some porn
implement this one

248
00:14:57,066 --> 00:15:01,295
as it'll insurer that your which is
content stays up-to-date

249
00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:04,988
so if this is implemented you'll be
passing completion hanlon

250
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:10,180
you want to perform your own update and
then determine what is the appropriate

251
00:15:10,018 --> 00:15:13,097
result to pass back in that block

252
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:17,050
so if you have some new data go ahead
and use NC update result

253
00:15:17,005 --> 00:15:20,904
new data if there's nothing new

254
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:24,951
go ahead news no data and if something
went horribly wrong

255
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:28,241
pass failed in will try to leave well
enough alone

256
00:15:29,069 --> 00:15:32,610
and then finally be sure to call the
completion handler with the result

257
00:15:32,061 --> 00:15:35,143
I that you have

258
00:15:36,043 --> 00:15:40,097
alright let's take a look at this

259
00:15:40,097 --> 00:15:44,192
so so you may remember from last year I
we had a presentation we showed off

260
00:15:45,092 --> 00:15:49,741
and awesome I O S application for
staying in touch with all the clowns

261
00:15:50,569 --> 00:15:54,120
that are in your clown network call that
clown town

262
00:15:54,012 --> 00:15:57,105
what we're gonna take this application a
little bit further by adding widgets

263
00:15:58,005 --> 00:16:01,144
for the Notification Center

264
00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:04,223
now adding a widget is as simple as
opening up an existing application

265
00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:06,540
project

266
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,170
and adding any target for both iowa's

267
00:16:10,017 --> 00:16:13,110
and OS 10 you'll see there's an
application extension section

268
00:16:14,001 --> 00:16:17,052
and you can just select the today
extension

269
00:16:17,061 --> 00:16:20,340
but I've actually already started work
on one sarin ago

270
00:16:20,889 --> 00:16:23,903
right into our view controller here

271
00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:27,097
switch its our view controllers and the
first thing I'm gonna do

272
00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:31,040
is ensure that my which it has the right
height

273
00:16:31,004 --> 00:16:36,963
so I'm using an interface builder
storyboard for my interface

274
00:16:36,999 --> 00:16:41,670
so awake from nearby is a pretty handy
place to take care of this

275
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:45,156
so after calling super and then setting
up a little state

276
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,160
I'm gonna go ahead and get the most
recent Posts

277
00:16:49,016 --> 00:16:52,375
once I've gotten those update my table
view

278
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:55,563
I'm this doesn't need to be animated
were just initializing here

279
00:16:55,959 --> 00:16:59,966
an important step is making sure to set
my preferred content sized

280
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:04,410
to this case just the content size at my
table view

281
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:07,092
so this'll make sure that were
initialized in the state were showing

282
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:10,110
a single post in our widget which is
nice

283
00:17:11,001 --> 00:17:14,028
but perhaps you want to see a little bit
more of what's going on in your clown

284
00:17:14,037 --> 00:17:15,055
network

285
00:17:15,055 --> 00:17:18,064
while how bout we add a button

286
00:17:18,064 --> 00:17:22,151
an action for Ubuntu show a little bit
more

287
00:17:23,051 --> 00:17:26,370
so the first thing will do is update our
state

288
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:30,460
and then calculate our preferred height
which sits reusing a table view on

289
00:17:30,046 --> 00:17:30,120
account the number

290
00:17:31,002 --> 00:17:35,067
rose and also make sure to account for
our full review

291
00:17:35,085 --> 00:17:40,130
what we have our preferred hi we want to
set are preferred content size

292
00:17:41,003 --> 00:17:44,025
and then make sure we tell ourselves
that we had to do an update

293
00:17:44,052 --> 00:17:47,060
in the future that'll come in handy
later

294
00:17:48,032 --> 00:17:52,083
so again we've set our preferred content
size so this will be sure to animate the

295
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,167
widget to the appropriate Hyatt

296
00:17:54,067 --> 00:17:58,206
but we want to make sure that our
content comes in a really nice animated

297
00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:01,490
fashion

298
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:04,122
and to do that will implement you will
transition to size

299
00:18:05,022 --> 00:18:09,087
with transition coordinator and so if we
have a coordinator

300
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:12,184
then we know that this is an animated
transition and so will call animate

301
00:18:13,084 --> 00:18:16,178
alongside transition completion

302
00:18:17,078 --> 00:18:21,093
to make sure to update our table view an
animated fashion

303
00:18:21,093 --> 00:18:24,109
and in the completion be sure I

304
00:18:25,009 --> 00:18:28,018
to update the title of our button up

305
00:18:28,018 --> 00:18:31,055
if for some reason we didn't get a
coordinator then we'll just

306
00:18:31,055 --> 00:18:35,150
up dinner table without animation and
then update the button

307
00:18:36,005 --> 00:18:40,086
so this will make sure that our I art
adding a bar rose comes in a nice

308
00:18:41,031 --> 00:18:42,059
animated way

309
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:45,081
alongside the system animation that's
resizing are widget

310
00:18:45,081 --> 00:18:51,144
now one more thing I want to do before
we give this a try

311
00:18:52,044 --> 00:18:55,099
that is making sure that our content
stays up-to-date so I'm and implement

312
00:18:55,099 --> 00:18:55,152
the method

313
00:18:56,052 --> 00:19:00,054
widget perform update with completion
handler

314
00:19:00,054 --> 00:19:03,095
so I'll start by getting the recent most
recent Posts make sure it get any

315
00:19:03,095 --> 00:19:04,157
updates

316
00:19:05,057 --> 00:19:09,063
and then calculate the result so if we
already know that we needed to do an

317
00:19:10,017 --> 00:19:10,025
update

318
00:19:10,097 --> 00:19:14,133
or if we actually did get some new
content they want to use NC update

319
00:19:15,033 --> 00:19:16,036
result new data

320
00:19:16,063 --> 00:19:21,115
otherwise we can just go ahead and use
no data

321
00:19:22,015 --> 00:19:25,040
so if we actually did get to new data

322
00:19:25,004 --> 00:19:28,012
wanna do a couple things will def want
to update our table view to ensure that

323
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:33,004
it's reflecting our most recent content

324
00:19:33,022 --> 00:19:37,096
and then up their preferred size to
ensure there which is the right height

325
00:19:37,096 --> 00:19:40,193
and in either case we certainly don't
need any more updates

326
00:19:41,093 --> 00:19:44,099
and will call our completion handler
with our result

327
00:19:45,053 --> 00:19:48,125
alright I think we can go ahead and give
this a shot

328
00:19:49,025 --> 00:19:54,091
so I'm gonna go ahead and build and run
for the simulator

329
00:19:54,091 --> 00:20:01,091
I'll switch over to the simulator now

330
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:05,093
ok and here we have our client an
application

331
00:20:05,093 --> 00:20:10,148
on a home out of this and present the
Notification Center

332
00:20:11,048 --> 00:20:16,087
go to the Edit menu and our which it is
not there

333
00:20:16,087 --> 00:20:19,151
the I excellent

334
00:20:20,051 --> 00:20:26,057
to give that one more shot

335
00:20:27,011 --> 00:20:33,014
well yes there we go

336
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:36,095
there's our application

337
00:20:36,095 --> 00:20:43,095
bring down this one new widget available
there it is

338
00:20:46,096 --> 00:20:50,113
alright so hit done and here's our
widget

339
00:20:51,013 --> 00:20:55,039
out we can see that Corbin icon has a
multi-colored suspenders is giving away

340
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:59,041
gonna make sure to picture alright his
arm or bun

341
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:03,059
we tap that get a new rose animate in
nicely

342
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:06,101
y la to weddings happening

343
00:21:07,001 --> 00:21:10,052
less class is everything back down and
nice animated fashion

344
00:21:10,052 --> 00:21:14,054
looking pretty good well i def wanna
know more about these multi-colored

345
00:21:14,054 --> 00:21:16,097
suspender somebody go ahead and

346
00:21:16,097 --> 00:21:20,100
how ok I what we've definitely seen

347
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,079
if you look at the the system widgets
that's a pretty common pattern to

348
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:28,126
tap something in the widget and then
transition to the application and maybe

349
00:21:29,026 --> 00:21:32,082
I see some more details or get some more
contact are well that's definitely

350
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,177
something that we're interested in doing

351
00:21:34,077 --> 00:21:39,113
so let's return excursion a stop to the
burger

352
00:21:40,013 --> 00:21:44,057
and since I'm using a table view I want
to implement able to you

353
00:21:44,057 --> 00:21:50,073
dislike throw it in XPath so after we
make sure we have a valid post

354
00:21:50,073 --> 00:21:54,073
ability to manage an object called
extension context

355
00:21:54,073 --> 00:21:58,107
now the extension contest is an object
it you have access to you in your widget

356
00:21:59,007 --> 00:22:03,026
are in any extension that's running in
host and it has a

357
00:22:03,026 --> 00:22:06,044
tell you some interesting things about
what's happening in your current host

358
00:22:06,044 --> 00:22:10,045
I'd also has a couple really interesting
methods in our case really take

359
00:22:10,045 --> 00:22:11,051
advantage of open URL

360
00:22:12,005 --> 00:22:16,029
completion handler now I have to find a
custom URL scheme that share between my

361
00:22:16,029 --> 00:22:17,078
which in my application

362
00:22:17,078 --> 00:22:20,084
so i cant construct the URL with this
scheme

363
00:22:20,084 --> 00:22:25,106
and then add some identifying
information for my post

364
00:22:26,006 --> 00:22:30,017
and then one final thing I want to do
just make sure to disliked this row so

365
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:33,104
it's not selected the next time the user
pose down notification center

366
00:22:34,004 --> 00:22:40,009
alright sort build and run this again

367
00:22:40,009 --> 00:22:45,082
here's our application present here

368
00:22:45,082 --> 00:22:48,133
at this back

369
00:22:49,033 --> 00:22:52,121
and here's Corbin again so let's see if
I tap this hopefully I'll be able to get

370
00:22:53,021 --> 00:22:55,108
some more information about the
suspenders there we go

371
00:22:56,008 --> 00:22:59,074
brings us right to the application gets
more detail make sure we don't miss out

372
00:22:59,074 --> 00:23:06,074
on the suspenders

373
00:23:11,047 --> 00:23:14,100
so few things to remember we deserve you
controllers

374
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,025
everything you know about view
controllers in the API and behaviors to

375
00:23:18,025 --> 00:23:19,054
serve you really well

376
00:23:19,054 --> 00:23:23,098
when you're constructing a rigid

377
00:23:23,098 --> 00:23:26,169
also be sure your Widgets resume
immediately you don't want users bring

378
00:23:27,069 --> 00:23:31,113
down notification center in tapping in
not having anything happen

379
00:23:32,013 --> 00:23:35,074
now while the notification center
handles layout not all widgets are

380
00:23:35,074 --> 00:23:36,173
created equal you want different heights

381
00:23:37,073 --> 00:23:41,127
you can do this with the preferred
height within the constraints in auto

382
00:23:42,027 --> 00:23:42,095
layout

383
00:23:42,095 --> 00:23:47,136
works closely through preferred content
size missus across both platforms

384
00:23:48,036 --> 00:23:51,078
also you want to be sure to you if you
enemy your content along with the resize

385
00:23:51,078 --> 00:23:51,086
animation

386
00:23:52,058 --> 00:23:55,099
this again we have API's on both I O S
and OS 10

387
00:23:55,099 --> 00:23:58,157
help you do this

388
00:23:59,057 --> 00:24:02,070
and then be sure to handle update
request to make sure that all the

389
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:05,015
content what's up today

390
00:24:06,005 --> 00:24:13,005
now I'd like to invite guy up on stage
to tell us about share extensions

391
00:24:15,072 --> 00:24:19,088
hi so my name is guy Fullerton and I am
an engineer on the IRS

392
00:24:19,088 --> 00:24:22,111
social an account teams and I'm gonna
give you everything you need to know to

393
00:24:23,011 --> 00:24:26,078
implement share extensions

394
00:24:26,078 --> 00:24:30,109
so sure extensions our way to take
sharing and upload functionality

395
00:24:31,009 --> 00:24:35,015
in your app and package it up and get
that presented in the sharing mood

396
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:39,044
standard activity and sharing
affordances in the operating system

397
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:43,048
shirts go back so like the US activity
view and share menu

398
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:47,071
in Mac OS 10 so this is particularly
useful

399
00:24:47,071 --> 00:24:50,077
for Social Network aP's or perhaps that
like to do video

400
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:56,065
or photo hosting for example a month and
other stuff

401
00:24:56,065 --> 00:25:00,120
so able to come a concrete example let's
have got a photo blogging application

402
00:25:01,002 --> 00:25:03,034
that normally allows major to launch the
app

403
00:25:03,052 --> 00:25:07,127
pick a photo from the photos library
i'ma take that a little bit maybe make

404
00:25:08,027 --> 00:25:11,031
a choose an audience to present it to
you and then upload it to a photoblog

405
00:25:11,067 --> 00:25:14,139
but wouldn't it be great if I could do
that upload directly from within Photos

406
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:15,098
app

407
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:20,142
well that's what share extension would
let you do so let's I am I mean photos

408
00:25:21,042 --> 00:25:24,129
I select the photo that I like tap the
share button

409
00:25:25,029 --> 00:25:28,040
pops the activity view and you can see
my phone about to look

410
00:25:28,004 --> 00:25:31,013
photo blog application icon there any
activity view

411
00:25:32,003 --> 00:25:35,072
tap that and up slides a compose cheaper
for a blog

412
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:38,167
let your user type some text to
annotated choose an audience whether

413
00:25:39,067 --> 00:25:40,072
they want to limit the

414
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:45,143
exposure that for and what not and
posted

415
00:25:46,043 --> 00:25:49,081
some going to hammer this home a lot the
next couple days but a lot of extensions

416
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:50,147
are basically just view controllers

417
00:25:51,047 --> 00:25:53,124
that's where most of the workers and you
probably aren't familiar with how to do

418
00:25:54,024 --> 00:25:54,092
that

419
00:25:54,092 --> 00:25:57,106
but share extensions have a couple other
concerns having to do with their

420
00:25:58,006 --> 00:25:58,070
packaging

421
00:25:58,007 --> 00:26:04,094
specifically the extensions in populist
so let's talk about that

422
00:26:05,057 --> 00:26:08,059
so normally when a share extension shows
up in one of these

423
00:26:08,059 --> 00:26:11,063
sharing affordances you generally want
that extension to have

424
00:26:11,099 --> 00:26:14,144
be absent name that's going to be the
thing the musician was for mayor

425
00:26:15,044 --> 00:26:18,047
from with looking for when they want to
select that extension

426
00:26:18,074 --> 00:26:21,095
but some applications may have multiple
share affordances

427
00:26:21,095 --> 00:26:25,129
I the photo blog for example might want
a basic posting share functionality

428
00:26:26,029 --> 00:26:30,086
and maybe once a way to specifically set
the blogs header photo for example

429
00:26:30,086 --> 00:26:33,150
so it's important to be able to
customize your share extensions name

430
00:26:34,005 --> 00:26:37,041
and the way you do that is with CF
mantel display name

431
00:26:37,086 --> 00:26:40,144
injury in populist just set that to the
name you want your share extension to

432
00:26:41,044 --> 00:26:41,113
show up with

433
00:26:42,013 --> 00:26:49,013
and sharing you I will display the name
appropriately for your extension

434
00:26:49,027 --> 00:26:52,085
so the next thing to talk about or
activation rules

435
00:26:52,085 --> 00:26:55,096
and this is probably best explain to an
example

436
00:26:55,096 --> 00:26:58,161
what's a year in photos and you have a
senate real things

437
00:26:59,061 --> 00:27:02,102
selected you get two photos and a video

438
00:27:03,002 --> 00:27:06,021
and user wants to share that so they tap
the share button

439
00:27:06,021 --> 00:27:10,047
a pops the are you actively view where
the share menu 10 X 10

440
00:27:10,047 --> 00:27:13,146
and behind-the-scenes we've created an
extension context

441
00:27:14,046 --> 00:27:18,051
net extension context is the conduit
that your extension we used the poll

442
00:27:18,051 --> 00:27:18,112
data

443
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:22,079
from the host application into itself so
this extension context for this

444
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:23,092
particular scenario

445
00:27:23,092 --> 00:27:26,101
has three things I'm it's got a
reference to two of those images

446
00:27:27,001 --> 00:27:31,017
and of course a reference to the video
as well now the user might have a bunch

447
00:27:31,017 --> 00:27:32,105
of share extensions on their system

448
00:27:33,005 --> 00:27:36,032
and each them wants to get involved in
different kinda situations

449
00:27:36,032 --> 00:27:39,058
and so the activation rules are with
that lets the system make the right

450
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:43,074
decision about which extensions to put
in the activity beware the share menu

451
00:27:43,074 --> 00:27:49,093
based on the kind of data that any
extension context

452
00:27:49,093 --> 00:27:52,157
there are two ways for your extension to
supply its activation

453
00:27:53,057 --> 00:27:57,138
horse the first as a predicate now every
extensions in populist

454
00:27:58,038 --> 00:28:01,046
has an NS extension dictionary and
within that and its extension dictionary

455
00:28:02,018 --> 00:28:03,090
is the NS extension attributes

456
00:28:03,009 --> 00:28:06,105
the system uses those attributes as part
of its decision-making process about

457
00:28:07,086 --> 00:28:08,145
which extensions to show

458
00:28:09,045 --> 00:28:12,119
but importantly for sharing stanchions
the Ennis activation rule

459
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:17,033
I with in the NS extension at Reese's
what you need to set

460
00:28:17,033 --> 00:28:21,055
if you set that to a string that the
predicate we will run that predicate in

461
00:28:21,055 --> 00:28:24,107
the host app and figure out if your
extension his appropriate and that

462
00:28:25,007 --> 00:28:27,026
predicate can be as detailed as you need
it to be

463
00:28:27,026 --> 00:28:30,072
were can be simple if you want to be
whatever you need to get the job done

464
00:28:30,072 --> 00:28:33,166
and this will serve the needs a lot of
extensions

465
00:28:34,066 --> 00:28:38,074
other extensions however I may have a
little more fine-grained

466
00:28:38,074 --> 00:28:41,166
what we found internally is that a lot
of our extensions just wanted to know

467
00:28:42,066 --> 00:28:43,072
basically just wanted to say

468
00:28:44,026 --> 00:28:49,050
that they support a basic setup images
more videos for some URL's attacked

469
00:28:49,005 --> 00:28:52,097
so we offer these condensed rules that
allow extensions to specify just those

470
00:28:53,042 --> 00:28:55,130
particular things without having to
write a complex predicates

471
00:28:56,003 --> 00:28:59,096
now ultimately these condensed rules
boil down to a predicate and behind the

472
00:29:00,023 --> 00:29:02,091
scenes but you don't need it worry about
that

473
00:29:02,091 --> 00:29:06,146
so to specify condense rules you still
put me in in NS activation rule insider

474
00:29:07,046 --> 00:29:08,073
and its extension attributes

475
00:29:08,073 --> 00:29:11,075
but this time it's a dictionary and
there are a number of keys you can put

476
00:29:11,075 --> 00:29:13,141
in a dictionary that indicate the amount
of that type of data

477
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:18,090
your extension is interested in

478
00:29:18,009 --> 00:29:22,075
now the bottom those two activation
rules both had to do with web content

479
00:29:23,056 --> 00:29:28,080
and they're slightly different we have a
web URL support and a webpage support

480
00:29:28,008 --> 00:29:31,080
and i wanna go into the details about
these so some

481
00:29:32,052 --> 00:29:35,131
share extensions are all about taking
the link you're currently looking at in

482
00:29:36,031 --> 00:29:36,037
Safari

483
00:29:36,091 --> 00:29:39,132
and posting it someplace else to some
vetoes somebody else can click on that

484
00:29:40,032 --> 00:29:41,113
link and go see the web page

485
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:45,038
for those kinds of sharing extensions
you want to specify that you support the

486
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:45,122
web URL

487
00:29:46,022 --> 00:29:50,029
with Max camp now another class
insurance tensions are all about looking

488
00:29:50,092 --> 00:29:52,151
at the page that Safari is currently got
displayed

489
00:29:53,051 --> 00:29:57,055
and polling data out on that page and
for those cheering extensions

490
00:29:57,055 --> 00:30:00,100
we have the web page with Max count
power activation will

491
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,057
now in order to support the web page
with Max count your extension also needs

492
00:30:05,057 --> 00:30:07,073
to supply a javascript that's run

493
00:30:07,073 --> 00:30:11,126
to determine what part the web content
actually stick on the extension context

494
00:30:12,026 --> 00:30:15,063
I'm not gonna go into detail on that
here but in tomorrow session we dive

495
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:15,100
into the

496
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,085
take detail on that so please check that
session a

497
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:25,121
hammering at home get again extensions
are basically just view controllers

498
00:30:26,021 --> 00:30:30,048
so it's a lot of familiar territory
share extensions can be implemented with

499
00:30:30,048 --> 00:30:31,074
two kinds view controllers

500
00:30:31,074 --> 00:30:34,126
on we support among both I O S and OS 10

501
00:30:35,026 --> 00:30:41,074
and you can subclass %um you control or
an issue control as you wish

502
00:30:41,074 --> 00:30:44,085
you probably already have you control
the code in your apt today that you can

503
00:30:44,085 --> 00:30:45,139
repurpose per share extension

504
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:49,092
sure maybe you wanna make some tweaks to
it too to conform better to make it a

505
00:30:49,092 --> 00:30:49,145
limited

506
00:30:50,045 --> 00:30:53,138
on another space you have on the screen
or what not but you take that existing

507
00:30:54,038 --> 00:30:54,089
code

508
00:30:54,089 --> 00:30:57,145
massage it a little bit and deployed an
extension and you can get to look

509
00:30:58,045 --> 00:31:00,092
exactly how you want using your own
branding

510
00:31:00,092 --> 00:31:03,146
existing you are whatever

511
00:31:04,046 --> 00:31:08,089
some extensions however want to conform
to the standard system share should look

512
00:31:08,089 --> 00:31:11,093
and for them we offer the SL compose
service you controller

513
00:31:12,029 --> 00:31:15,030
that you can subclass to get among other
things the standard

514
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,091
book standard animations text editing

515
00:31:18,091 --> 00:31:22,114
a indication the remaining characters
based on the characters type so far

516
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:26,078
I the post and Cancel buttons built in
previewing

517
00:31:26,078 --> 00:31:30,147
and other limited matter customization

518
00:31:31,047 --> 00:31:33,056
so once you've implemented your view
controller the next thing you need to be

519
00:31:34,037 --> 00:31:34,121
concerned about

520
00:31:35,021 --> 00:31:39,030
is actually doing the upload or post to
wherever you're sharing stated

521
00:31:39,003 --> 00:31:42,080
the key here is that you need to use an
issue /url session

522
00:31:43,007 --> 00:31:46,081
with a background session configuration
reason being

523
00:31:46,081 --> 00:31:49,102
your extension does not live beyond its
presentation

524
00:31:50,002 --> 00:31:53,015
at least not very long and we'll talk
more about that tomorrow

525
00:31:53,015 --> 00:31:56,053
so you need to make sure that by using a
background in this URL session

526
00:31:56,053 --> 00:32:00,122
you're allowing the system to handle the
upload for you

527
00:32:01,022 --> 00:32:04,078
secret a background in this world
session configuration build an issue

528
00:32:04,078 --> 00:32:06,131
I'll session around that

529
00:32:07,031 --> 00:32:10,067
build an issue are URL request that I

530
00:32:10,067 --> 00:32:14,121
encompasses the items that are being
shared and create and upload task

531
00:32:15,021 --> 00:32:16,080
wrapped around

532
00:32:16,008 --> 00:32:20,054
an issue or a crest and then start that
up a task

533
00:32:21,026 --> 00:32:24,122
once you've done that the system is
gonna handle the upload for you

534
00:32:25,022 --> 00:32:28,048
at that point your extension needs to
tell the host ap

535
00:32:28,048 --> 00:32:31,072
that it's done and you can tell down the
presentation a view controller

536
00:32:31,072 --> 00:32:34,134
and you do that by calling a method on
the extension contact called complete

537
00:32:35,034 --> 00:32:41,068
request returning items completion
handler

538
00:32:41,068 --> 00:32:44,159
if the user chooses to cancel your sheet
or whatever your presentation happens to

539
00:32:45,059 --> 00:32:45,100
be

540
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,037
there's another extension context meant
that you need call has called cancel

541
00:32:49,037 --> 00:32:49,096
request

542
00:32:49,096 --> 00:32:54,157
with your so mad already talked about
performance with request

543
00:32:55,057 --> 00:32:58,066
with respect to the today which is and i
wanna talk about that a little bit

544
00:32:59,047 --> 00:32:59,115
different way

545
00:33:00,015 --> 00:33:04,102
in terms of share tensions I'm sure
extensions often have to grab a bunch of

546
00:33:05,002 --> 00:33:06,023
data from the host at

547
00:33:06,023 --> 00:33:09,045
they might be dealing with 10 photos for
an enormous video

548
00:33:09,045 --> 00:33:12,046
and it can be expensive to be pulling
out from the host ap

549
00:33:12,046 --> 00:33:15,081
while the presentation is happening so
if you notice

550
00:33:15,081 --> 00:33:18,134
that I your your presentation mission is
staggering

551
00:33:19,034 --> 00:33:22,070
you may need for someone that heavy
lifting until after the presentation is

552
00:33:22,007 --> 00:33:24,033
completed

553
00:33:24,096 --> 00:33:26,183
if you some question would you
controller an issue controller do

554
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:28,168
whatever makes sense for the rest if
your code

555
00:33:29,068 --> 00:33:32,146
just two for that task so it's not
impacting the animation

556
00:33:33,046 --> 00:33:36,047
if you subclass SL compose service be
controller however

557
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:39,141
we will call your subclasses
presentation animation did finish method

558
00:33:40,041 --> 00:33:47,041
giving your I'm you control a good hook
with which to start that heavy lifting

559
00:33:48,016 --> 00:33:52,041
so let's take a look at the photo blog
app and a photoblog share extension

560
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:57,062
quick

561
00:33:57,062 --> 00:34:00,103
before going into the code I'm gonna
show you the

562
00:34:01,003 --> 00:34:05,011
sure extension running so some legal
make a little bit more sense

563
00:34:05,011 --> 00:34:08,069
so we're gonna go into for us just like
that for the screenshots I showed speak

564
00:34:08,069 --> 00:34:10,122
a different one

565
00:34:11,022 --> 00:34:14,481
puppies a.m.

566
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:18,450
and I will do just one so no it's not
true that

567
00:34:18,045 --> 00:34:22,103
there we go click on the Forgot your
extension and up comes the composer you

568
00:34:23,003 --> 00:34:24,079
so this is clearly using

569
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,156
the standard system composed she looked
arrive from são compose service few

570
00:34:28,056 --> 00:34:28,625
controller

571
00:34:29,129 --> 00:34:33,970
and you can do a couple different things
a you can take some taxed

572
00:34:33,097 --> 00:34:37,016
and as I'm typing text kinda hard to see
but is a little indicator the remaining

573
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:41,290
characters and once I type too much text
it goes negative

574
00:34:41,029 --> 00:34:44,828
and the post button disables this is all
happening more or less for for you'll

575
00:34:45,089 --> 00:34:47,096
see some details when we look at the
code

576
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:50,176
the image preview their it happens for
free

577
00:34:50,329 --> 00:34:53,335
the base class will be there for you we
also

578
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:57,310
this particular subclass adds an
audience picker

579
00:34:57,031 --> 00:35:00,073
so this photo blog supports the notion
of posting publicly I

580
00:35:00,073 --> 00:35:03,109
or only to my friends were completely
primarily in you can choose a different

581
00:35:04,009 --> 00:35:04,101
audience

582
00:35:05,001 --> 00:35:09,027
treats text here so we're within

583
00:35:09,027 --> 00:35:13,033
the allowed range and we can post so
let's go back in Xcode

584
00:35:13,033 --> 00:35:17,042
and see how we implement that

585
00:35:18,023 --> 00:35:21,082
so the first thing I did it's hard to
see sorry but this is skills they can do

586
00:35:21,082 --> 00:35:24,091
with the hippie with the first thing I
did was set the panel display name for

587
00:35:24,091 --> 00:35:24,179
my extension

588
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:29,088
2400 block and I set up an activation
rule

589
00:35:29,088 --> 00:35:32,126
I this particular activation will says
my share extension

590
00:35:33,026 --> 00:35:35,122
only once one image that's all you need
to give me I don't care about anything

591
00:35:36,022 --> 00:35:40,100
else this is one time relevant

592
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,029
and now my view controller so mine

593
00:35:44,029 --> 00:35:47,107
you controller subclasses from são
compose service we control our

594
00:35:48,007 --> 00:35:51,065
now take a look at the implementation
before Easter & Co to this

595
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:54,094
I want to talk about a couple artificial
constraints for this demo app so for

596
00:35:54,094 --> 00:35:54,169
purposes

597
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:59,072
up showing off the remaining characters
count and I generally updating the

598
00:35:59,099 --> 00:35:59,174
postman

599
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:03,151
I'm gonna say that my photoblog has two
constraints associated with it

600
00:36:04,051 --> 00:36:07,108
the first is that no photo can be posted
with more than 20 characters

601
00:36:08,008 --> 00:36:11,015
a alongside the photo because it's meant
to just let you see the photo and not

602
00:36:11,078 --> 00:36:12,129
get distracted by the text

603
00:36:13,029 --> 00:36:15,120
and also it's supposed to be a
lightweight for a blog doesn't wanna

604
00:36:16,002 --> 00:36:18,013
spend it on a storage space on the
photos

605
00:36:18,031 --> 00:36:22,032
so no photo that you post can be bigger
than one megabyte

606
00:36:22,032 --> 00:36:25,086
and this class constraint is
particularly important because when you

607
00:36:25,086 --> 00:36:27,097
pull data from the host application

608
00:36:27,097 --> 00:36:31,116
you're not in control of the day decide
if you've got a photo coming from Photos

609
00:36:32,016 --> 00:36:33,078
app it might be quite large

610
00:36:33,078 --> 00:36:36,097
and therefore its your extensions
responsibility down sample that image

611
00:36:36,097 --> 00:36:40,140
data to fit within your size constraint

612
00:36:41,004 --> 00:36:44,053
so let's start implementing view
controller

613
00:36:44,089 --> 00:36:47,132
so I'm gonna add an image data property
to my subclass this is going to be the

614
00:36:48,032 --> 00:36:50,033
fully down sampled image data

615
00:36:50,033 --> 00:36:53,115
that i'm gonna ultimately upload to the
photoblog

616
00:36:54,015 --> 00:36:59,069
I'm going to keep track of the audience
that be user wants to post it to you

617
00:36:59,069 --> 00:37:02,078
and I'm gonna keep configuration item
that i'm gonna talk about a little bit

618
00:37:02,078 --> 00:37:02,171
later on

619
00:37:03,071 --> 00:37:06,155
basically this represents that audience
bigger table cell down in the bottom

620
00:37:07,055 --> 00:37:12,149
have the compose p

621
00:37:13,049 --> 00:37:16,097
all right sir you did load we're going
to

622
00:37:16,097 --> 00:37:19,125
initialize the audience we already have
a utility routine in our apt that knows

623
00:37:20,025 --> 00:37:23,027
how to fetch the right default audience
based on a number of factors so we're

624
00:37:23,027 --> 00:37:26,114
just gonna be used that quote from the
app

625
00:37:27,014 --> 00:37:31,028
now a those constraints I was talking
about the twenty character limit

626
00:37:31,028 --> 00:37:35,045
and the down sampling both need to
affect whether the post button

627
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:39,045
is enabled so if the user is tight more
than 20 characters

628
00:37:39,045 --> 00:37:42,138
we don't want them to be able to post if
the down samples not finished

629
00:37:43,038 --> 00:37:46,091
likewise we don't want them to be able
to post so we need to make sure the post

630
00:37:46,091 --> 00:37:48,093
button is disabled in those cases

631
00:37:49,011 --> 00:37:52,017
also since we're using the remaining
character count indicator

632
00:37:52,071 --> 00:37:55,142
we need to make sure that up to date at
all times the right place to do that

633
00:37:56,042 --> 00:38:00,068
is the is content valid method SL
compose service view controller calls

634
00:38:00,068 --> 00:38:00,114
your

635
00:38:01,014 --> 00:38:04,017
subclasses is content valid method
whenever it needs to update the status

636
00:38:04,044 --> 00:38:06,141
on the post button to give your chance
to do those things

637
00:38:07,041 --> 00:38:11,045
for temperament some other the first
thing I want to do is look at the

638
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:14,092
are number of characters that the users
type so far

639
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:17,141
SL compose service to controller has a
content text property

640
00:38:18,041 --> 00:38:23,085
which is the text that these are state
so far so we grab a drink

641
00:38:23,085 --> 00:38:25,157
next week actually the number of
characters remaining based on our photo

642
00:38:26,057 --> 00:38:29,121
blogs constraint

643
00:38:30,021 --> 00:38:33,065
then we set eso composers Wii
controllers characters remaining

644
00:38:33,065 --> 00:38:33,159
property

645
00:38:34,059 --> 00:38:37,110
this is an NS number by setting that too
and in this number

646
00:38:38,001 --> 00:38:41,005
the base class automatically updates the
text

647
00:38:41,014 --> 00:38:44,021
on the composure she trefor start to
reflect the number of characters you

648
00:38:44,084 --> 00:38:51,084
still have worked

649
00:38:54,259 --> 00:38:57,160
to stand here so next we're going to
same

650
00:38:57,016 --> 00:39:01,085
that the post but should be enabled if
the user is not types too much text

651
00:39:01,229 --> 00:39:05,305
and if we already have a fully down
sampled image data otherwise

652
00:39:05,989 --> 00:39:10,047
don't enable the post but now we've got
to get a fully down temple image data

653
00:39:10,569 --> 00:39:13,571
and like I said this can be a
potentially expensive operations we

654
00:39:13,589 --> 00:39:15,606
don't know how much data is gonna be
coming over from the house

655
00:39:15,759 --> 00:39:18,792
so we wanted to for that to presentation
animation did finish

656
00:39:19,089 --> 00:39:23,153
this method is called by sub called on
subclasses a vessel compose service few

657
00:39:23,729 --> 00:39:23,787
controller

658
00:39:24,309 --> 00:39:30,720
after decompose she has slid up on
screen so the first thing we're gonna do

659
00:39:30,072 --> 00:39:33,121
is look at the extension context again
and in particular look at the input

660
00:39:33,769 --> 00:39:34,400
items

661
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:37,203
now I'm gonna go off from the weed a
little bit here but bear with me

662
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:40,644
the extension context can have multiple
input items

663
00:39:41,049 --> 00:39:45,127
on it each input item represents a
separate upload

664
00:39:45,829 --> 00:39:49,920
block for most share extensions

665
00:39:49,092 --> 00:39:53,401
you only care about doing one uploaded
the time but you might imagine a

666
00:39:54,229 --> 00:39:56,285
particular sharing extension that
allowed to do

667
00:39:56,789 --> 00:40:00,900
5 posts 21 social network at one go so
for that kinda

668
00:40:00,009 --> 00:40:02,678
hypothetical chair extension you're
gonna need to look at all the input

669
00:40:03,569 --> 00:40:03,620
items

670
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:08,146
but since this photo blog extension only
cares about posting one photo at a time

671
00:40:08,749 --> 00:40:09,773
with one post at a time

672
00:40:09,989 --> 00:40:16,062
we just look at the first input on next
we're going to iterate over all the

673
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:17,660
attachments

674
00:40:17,066 --> 00:40:22,395
on that extension I'm I each extension
eat each post request could come with

675
00:40:22,989 --> 00:40:24,210
multiple pieces a day to

676
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:28,130
like you could go into photos and select
two photos can choose to share that

677
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:31,322
you would have a extension contacts with
one item

678
00:40:31,349 --> 00:40:35,450
with two attachments so we're going in
to rate over the attachments and find

679
00:40:35,045 --> 00:40:36,047
the photo that we care about

680
00:40:36,065 --> 00:40:39,734
so what we do is we

681
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:44,337
we iterate over all the other providers
in the extension item and we call has I

682
00:40:44,499 --> 00:40:45,583
don't conform to type it in a fire

683
00:40:46,339 --> 00:40:50,391
passing K U T take image this is hey I
don't provider do you have an image

684
00:40:50,859 --> 00:40:54,380
in you and if we find out but the answer
is yes

685
00:40:54,038 --> 00:40:57,737
we're going to do some work we're gonna
need a poll that particular item

686
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:01,151
fighters data and we're gonna wanna do
that on a background cue so as to not

687
00:41:01,799 --> 00:41:05,867
hi disrupt the main thread and since we
found the one image that we support

688
00:41:06,479 --> 00:41:09,563
we can stop generating now silly

689
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:13,334
actual work pulling the data happens
with the

690
00:41:13,469 --> 00:41:16,508
load item for type identifiers options

691
00:41:16,859 --> 00:41:21,140
completion had limited again saying
gimme some UT type

692
00:41:21,014 --> 00:41:25,463
image please and the completion heavily
handle the past actually has a flexible

693
00:41:25,589 --> 00:41:26,604
first parameter

694
00:41:26,739 --> 00:41:29,802
indicates the way you would like the
item provider to supply your data

695
00:41:30,369 --> 00:41:33,436
in this case my share extension is
interested in NSA a

696
00:41:34,039 --> 00:41:38,064
so that's what my completion has
protected and

697
00:41:38,289 --> 00:41:41,950
when hi get the school

698
00:41:41,095 --> 00:41:44,934
for me civic breakthrough wider rap so
much

699
00:41:45,789 --> 00:41:48,814
I'm it's important to note

700
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:53,065
that no doubt have happened in a fire
completes on an arbitrary cue

701
00:41:53,299 --> 00:41:56,306
and since we're going to view controller
work I'm gonna need to dispatch a sink

702
00:41:56,369 --> 00:41:57,960
under the main she'd actually do that
work

703
00:41:57,096 --> 00:42:02,098
and I'm gonna call a method on my psych
class called image data loaded finish in

704
00:42:03,016 --> 00:42:03,067
passive

705
00:42:03,067 --> 00:42:10,067
idea let's go implement that

706
00:42:16,002 --> 00:42:19,045
so my application already has down
sampling code right that's what it would

707
00:42:19,045 --> 00:42:19,087
need

708
00:42:19,087 --> 00:42:22,089
in the normal case in normal application
case I'm just going to repurpose that

709
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:26,074
and ask it to down sample the image data
passing mapsize

710
00:42:26,074 --> 00:42:29,103
and that's going to complete on an
arbitrary cue so again

711
00:42:30,003 --> 00:42:33,027
once it completes I'm gonna give you
control it works I dispatch a sink onto

712
00:42:33,027 --> 00:42:33,122
the main cue

713
00:42:34,022 --> 00:42:37,022
and then I remember the down sample
image data

714
00:42:37,022 --> 00:42:40,121
now that I've got that image data I need
a post button to get updated

715
00:42:41,021 --> 00:42:44,072
and the way I do that is call a method
on SL compose you control a commonality

716
00:42:44,072 --> 00:42:48,101
content validate content calls your
subclasses

717
00:42:49,001 --> 00:42:52,023
is content validated and gives it
another chance to determine whether or

718
00:42:52,023 --> 00:42:52,067
not

719
00:42:52,067 --> 00:42:59,067
that enable the post button

720
00:43:01,009 --> 00:43:05,014
okay so when the user taps the post
button

721
00:43:05,095 --> 00:43:09,108
on SL compose new controller subclass I
we call that subclasses

722
00:43:10,008 --> 00:43:14,008
did select post method so let's react to
that

723
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:17,070
the first thing we're gonna do is
perform the upload

724
00:43:17,007 --> 00:43:20,035
and after that we need to tell the host
that

725
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:23,106
are extensions done you can dismiss our
view controller and again we do that by

726
00:43:24,006 --> 00:43:24,012
calling

727
00:43:24,066 --> 00:43:27,078
and that on extension contest called
complete request returning items

728
00:43:27,078 --> 00:43:30,115
completion handler so it's at look at
the Apple again

729
00:43:31,015 --> 00:43:34,049
so the upload is going to be very
similar to what I already showed on the

730
00:43:34,049 --> 00:43:35,131
slides but let's go through it again
because it's

731
00:43:36,031 --> 00:43:40,119
very important for extensions because
they have a short life span first thing

732
00:43:41,019 --> 00:43:41,108
we're gonna do you

733
00:43:42,008 --> 00:43:45,094
is create K background in a swirl
session configuration

734
00:43:45,094 --> 00:43:50,130
create an issue or a session from that
configuration

735
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:55,006
and create a request representing the
upload

736
00:43:55,033 --> 00:43:59,052
now again this is code we stole much
told called we borrowed from the main

737
00:43:59,349 --> 00:44:00,140
application

738
00:44:00,014 --> 00:44:03,041
that building an issuer local request
from the photo data

739
00:44:03,041 --> 00:44:06,064
I from the context that the user is
typing the audience

740
00:44:06,064 --> 00:44:09,523
building upload task around that request

741
00:44:10,099 --> 00:44:17,099
and then start to happen now in this
particular case

742
00:44:18,042 --> 00:44:23,721
I well as he lets her back for a second
so we implemented it's like post method

743
00:44:24,099 --> 00:44:28,650
eso composers you controller will also
call aidid select Cancel method

744
00:44:28,065 --> 00:44:31,068
on your subclass but in this particular
case

745
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:34,997
we don't need to implement the default
implementation and it's like cancer will

746
00:44:35,609 --> 00:44:37,683
go ahead and cancel the attention
context for you automatically

747
00:44:38,349 --> 00:44:42,140
but if your extension needs to do some
cleanup work in response to a cancel

748
00:44:42,014 --> 00:44:46,018
you can override it select Cancel so
that a No

749
00:44:46,018 --> 00:44:49,072
to handle the basic uploading and
interaction with the sheet

750
00:44:49,072 --> 00:44:52,073
but at the bottom of the sheet Murray
there is that little audience pick your

751
00:44:52,082 --> 00:44:52,124
cell

752
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:58,029
I'll show you how to implement that the
base class will call your subclasses

753
00:44:58,074 --> 00:44:59,143
configuration items method

754
00:45:00,043 --> 00:45:03,047
as a way to give your subclass a chance
to supply

755
00:45:03,047 --> 00:45:06,103
that set up table cells to put on the a
bottom-up share she

756
00:45:07,003 --> 00:45:10,071
so we can implement the configuration
Adams method its are subclasses

757
00:45:10,071 --> 00:45:11,450
responsibility

758
00:45:12,089 --> 00:45:16,170
to return an array es el cumple she
configuration items

759
00:45:16,017 --> 00:45:19,099
one for each configuration item in the
table now the example here

760
00:45:19,099 --> 00:45:22,099
only has one configuration item but you
might imagine a

761
00:45:22,099 --> 00:45:25,138
share extension that means multiples in
fact some the built-in system

762
00:45:26,038 --> 00:45:29,054
extensions have multiples configuration
and on the bottom

763
00:45:29,054 --> 00:45:32,130
so we instantiate 1 and we said

764
00:45:33,003 --> 00:45:36,072
title the title is what's displayed on
the left side of the table cell

765
00:45:36,369 --> 00:45:40,010
and we said its value which is the
audience displayed on the right side of

766
00:45:40,001 --> 00:45:40,074
the table cell

767
00:45:40,074 --> 00:45:44,183
and then we need to react to when that
table sellers tapped

768
00:45:44,849 --> 00:45:47,898
and when we do that is by setting a tap
handle on the configuration

769
00:45:48,339 --> 00:45:52,320
now I'm gonna avoid to retain cycle
between my view controller

770
00:45:52,032 --> 00:45:55,039
any configuration item but capturing a
weak reference to myself

771
00:45:55,039 --> 00:45:59,064
inside the tap handler and then what we
do is we got a strong reference to do

772
00:45:59,064 --> 00:46:00,078
that week strong dance

773
00:46:00,078 --> 00:46:03,102
and if our view controller is still
around on

774
00:46:04,002 --> 00:46:07,013
at that point we know the table cells
been tapped we want to show that

775
00:46:07,013 --> 00:46:08,052
audience paper you why

776
00:46:08,052 --> 00:46:11,052
so we've already implemented in audience
pick your view controller

777
00:46:11,052 --> 00:46:14,107
it's just a basic table view controller
that happens to be in. specific for this

778
00:46:15,007 --> 00:46:15,090
particular use

779
00:46:15,009 --> 00:46:21,011
so we instantiate a we set ourselves to
be its delegate

780
00:46:21,092 --> 00:46:24,094
our custom audience bigger view
controller class has a delegate method

781
00:46:24,094 --> 00:46:24,175
it's called

782
00:46:25,075 --> 00:46:29,092
when the user taps an audience so that
we get to react to the specific audience

783
00:46:29,092 --> 00:46:29,167
chosen

784
00:46:30,067 --> 00:46:34,120
we're gonna tell it what the currently
selected audiences so I can check

785
00:46:35,002 --> 00:46:42,002
the right thing and then we're gonna
call a method on its ok oppose service

786
00:46:42,092 --> 00:46:45,119
you control a telling it to please enemy
this other be control or on screen and

787
00:46:46,019 --> 00:46:46,082
the method is

788
00:46:46,082 --> 00:46:49,144
push configuration new controller so
this slides your

789
00:46:50,044 --> 00:46:53,723
new view controller in a navigation
controller like style and resizes the

790
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:54,191
computer she

791
00:46:54,839 --> 00:47:01,839
to fit your view controllers past
desired size and then finally

792
00:47:02,003 --> 00:47:06,019
now that we've implemented that we can
return are single configuration item

793
00:47:06,019 --> 00:47:07,178
from configurations

794
00:47:07,349 --> 00:47:13,350
alright so here is our daily a method
that is called when the audience pick

795
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:14,730
your view controller

796
00:47:14,073 --> 00:47:19,120
sees beer tap a cell we need to react to
that we're gonna remember the selected

797
00:47:20,002 --> 00:47:20,060
audience

798
00:47:20,078 --> 00:47:23,137
we're gonna tell our configuration item

799
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:27,050
hey it's got a new value and by doing at
the table cell is updated automatically

800
00:47:27,005 --> 00:47:30,071
showing the new audience

801
00:47:30,071 --> 00:47:33,077
and finally what ought to dismiss that
audience bigger view controller

802
00:47:34,031 --> 00:47:38,066
I'm you don't have to lose it really
depends on what your configuration items

803
00:47:38,066 --> 00:47:38,075
needs are

804
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:42,105
but generally for this kind of simple
audience picker want to tap a cell you

805
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:44,190
wanted to swipe away

806
00:47:44,019 --> 00:47:48,020
revealing the main compose she so this
is just a boilerplate code for executing

807
00:47:48,002 --> 00:47:49,077
code after a short delay

808
00:47:49,095 --> 00:47:52,152
and then we call pop configuration new
controller

809
00:47:53,052 --> 00:47:56,103
so in a navigation controller like way
this says remove the Thomas B controller

810
00:47:57,003 --> 00:47:57,088
from the stack

811
00:47:57,088 --> 00:48:00,090
and since we only had one there it
restores the

812
00:48:01,008 --> 00:48:04,014
the fall churches appearance

813
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:08,026
so that is it let's go ahead and rerun
this guy and take a look at it one more

814
00:48:08,026 --> 00:48:15,026
time

815
00:48:17,004 --> 00:48:19,663
for a blog at its hometowns

816
00:48:20,059 --> 00:48:24,098
go back to photos as our photo

817
00:48:24,449 --> 00:48:27,498
weekend bring up the photo by extension
and there it is

818
00:48:27,939 --> 00:48:33,971
we can choose an audience make a comment

819
00:48:34,259 --> 00:48:40,650
and pursuant so that's how you make a
shared vision for Iowa's

820
00:48:40,065 --> 00:48:44,090
but if you are looking at the expo
project closely you can see that there's

821
00:48:44,009 --> 00:48:44,478
a couple

822
00:48:45,369 --> 00:48:49,441
West End targets and their and now it
turns out that shared

823
00:48:50,089 --> 00:48:53,900
yeah tights more stuff that's your
extensions

824
00:48:53,009 --> 00:48:57,358
are very portable now it was pretty easy
for me to take my eyelash extension

825
00:48:58,249 --> 00:49:01,332
and massage the coat a little bit for OS
10 hand so that

826
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:06,630
is working here I can go to some photos

827
00:49:06,063 --> 00:49:12,162
select a full preview it bring up the
share menu

828
00:49:12,729 --> 00:49:15,823
painters my photo blog item and there's
my OS 10

829
00:49:16,669 --> 00:49:23,669
4 o'clock your country he so that demo
was all about a subclass a vessel

830
00:49:30,449 --> 00:49:31,491
compose service view controller

831
00:49:31,869 --> 00:49:34,875
but we know a lot of Extension
developers are gonna wanna just subclass

832
00:49:34,929 --> 00:49:34,996
from UAB

833
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:38,601
view controller and SQ controller and
we'd love you to do that cuz you can go

834
00:49:38,619 --> 00:49:41,626
to town and customize the wine for your
branding and whatnot

835
00:49:41,689 --> 00:49:45,640
but the basic work that you need to do
beyond implementing the new controller

836
00:49:45,064 --> 00:49:47,089
is pretty much what are you changing the
demo

837
00:49:47,089 --> 00:49:50,318
you get those info pls concerns you need
is still set your

838
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:55,390
on your display name are you need still
provide your activation rules

839
00:49:55,039 --> 00:49:58,368
and you still need to do you upload
within an issue or a background section

840
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:03,738
see just learned

841
00:50:03,909 --> 00:50:07,942
all about ap extensions you learned a
little bit about to have a packaged

842
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:11,274
about the different extension points
have a communication works between the

843
00:50:11,589 --> 00:50:11,648
host

844
00:50:12,179 --> 00:50:15,182
and the extension itself you learn how
to make

845
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:19,400
a two-day widget and a share extension
on both I O S

846
00:50:19,004 --> 00:50:22,053
and OS 10 so go take a look at your
applications

847
00:50:22,089 --> 00:50:25,468
figure out what pieces if you're sharing
functionality or other functionality

848
00:50:26,269 --> 00:50:29,364
you can package up into an act extension
and deploy so we think this is really

849
00:50:30,219 --> 00:50:33,295
cool technology and we're really looking
forward to all the good features and

850
00:50:33,979 --> 00:50:36,003
functionality you're able to supply
users

851
00:50:36,219 --> 00:50:43,219
with your extensions here

852
00:50:45,006 --> 00:50:48,084
take barings is our Super Avenger with
we have really comprehensive ap

853
00:50:49,038 --> 00:50:50,090
extensions programming guide

854
00:50:50,009 --> 00:50:53,057
goes into tons in detail on all the
SharePoint in all the mechanics in all

855
00:50:54,038 --> 00:50:54,077
this

856
00:50:54,077 --> 00:50:58,118
tomorrow we have another great extension
session where we go into detail on more

857
00:50:59,018 --> 00:51:00,026
more SharePoint

858
00:51:00,026 --> 00:51:03,121
I we also talk about more the underlying
infrastructure

859
00:51:04,021 --> 00:51:08,067
we also go into great detail on the
JavaScript support for web content

860
00:51:08,067 --> 00:51:12,080
and importantly more detail on the
extension context in an aside a provider

861
00:51:12,008 --> 00:51:14,067
so there's tons a good information I
refer to check those out

862
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:19,068
we have two labs where you can talk to a
sapling in years we'd love to get you

863
00:51:19,068 --> 00:51:20,142
started implementing your share
extensions

864
00:51:21,042 --> 00:51:25,047
one of those labs immediately after this
so previous downstairs would love to

865
00:51:25,047 --> 00:51:25,081
chat

866
00:51:25,081 --> 00:51:25,133
thank you
