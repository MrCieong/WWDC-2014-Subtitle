1
00:00:11,057 --> 00:00:13,102
good afternoon I'm John Kavanagh

2
00:00:14,002 --> 00:00:16,035
and I manage the group that creates the

3
00:00:16,035 --> 00:00:19,070
I'm impatient for all about polls
consumer in pro products

4
00:00:19,007 --> 00:00:23,095
here's some of what we do print pieces
that come in the box

5
00:00:24,058 --> 00:00:31,058
iBooks and PDF's I help topics that
appear in the OS 10 help viewer

6
00:00:32,084 --> 00:00:36,090
we have some highly contextual in app
solutions

7
00:00:36,009 --> 00:00:40,096
and deliverables on the web like these I
O S user guides

8
00:00:41,077 --> 00:00:44,093
or this what's new experience you may
have seen

9
00:00:44,093 --> 00:00:47,172
in OS 10 maverick's now

10
00:00:48,072 --> 00:00:51,077
creating great customer documentation

11
00:00:52,022 --> 00:00:56,108
isn't always seen as one of the most
exciting parts of software development

12
00:00:57,008 --> 00:01:02,042
I realize that as the documentation guy
and it can often be treated as it

13
00:01:02,042 --> 00:01:06,090
an afterthought by developers not the
developers in this room of course the

14
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:07,070
let's just say some developers

15
00:01:08,051 --> 00:01:13,086
and when that's the case it can often
take the form

16
00:01:13,086 --> 00:01:16,205
a van FAQ for help system

17
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:20,080
where basically you wait until a person
gets stock

18
00:01:20,008 --> 00:01:23,081
drop them into a comprehensive body of
content

19
00:01:23,081 --> 00:01:26,128
and then have them fend for themselves
to try to get answers

20
00:01:27,028 --> 00:01:32,077
and historically icons like this have
been used to

21
00:01:32,077 --> 00:01:37,316
represent the experience which really
isn't the most flattering image to have

22
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:39,250
associated

23
00:01:39,025 --> 00:01:43,077
with your ap our game unless of course

24
00:01:43,077 --> 00:01:46,486
it's about rescuing people lost at sea I
don't know

25
00:01:47,179 --> 00:01:50,240
now this

26
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:53,840
get answers strategy it it does have its
place

27
00:01:54,299 --> 00:02:00,310
in help systems for deeper aP's but as i
OS developers you probably don't even

28
00:02:00,031 --> 00:02:01,150
have to go here

29
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:04,780
instead

30
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:07,144
rachel's gonna show you how to
anticipate users needs

31
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:11,136
in a seamless on boarding experience so
they won't even feel like they're

32
00:02:12,036 --> 00:02:12,045
getting your help

33
00:02:13,026 --> 00:02:16,060
they'll just feel as though they're
experiencing your amazing

34
00:02:16,006 --> 00:02:21,072
after game she's also gonna show you how
to extend this strategy

35
00:02:22,026 --> 00:02:25,052
into an area we like to call inform and
inspire

36
00:02:25,052 --> 00:02:28,079
and that gives you the opportunity

37
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:31,171
to delight users by showing them what's
possible

38
00:02:32,071 --> 00:02:36,140
now as I said there's great ways to do
this

39
00:02:37,004 --> 00:02:40,091
and not so great ways and that so
rachel's gonna show you now

40
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:48,027
Rachel hi everyone

41
00:02:48,049 --> 00:02:51,071
my name is Rachel Roth and I'm wanna
Apple's

42
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:54,077
user experience for fans of so

43
00:02:54,077 --> 00:02:57,086
today we're gonna talk about onboarding

44
00:02:57,086 --> 00:03:02,102
and welcoming people now term onboarding
you may have heard it called

45
00:03:03,002 --> 00:03:07,100
the new user experience for that first
youth experience or

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,043
I what happens in a tutorial for game

47
00:03:11,043 --> 00:03:15,046
I'm really on morning for a term that
traditionally associated with

48
00:03:15,073 --> 00:03:18,076
what happens with employees when they
first started a company

49
00:03:19,003 --> 00:03:22,036
how people acquire the knowledge and the
skill

50
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:25,055
behaviors to become successful their job

51
00:03:25,055 --> 00:03:28,082
now when it comes to an hour our game

52
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:31,100
people are gonna go for a similar sort
of experience

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,009
they need to figure out you know how the
UI work

54
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:39,033
how the gameplay the staff really gonna
be right for me

55
00:03:39,033 --> 00:03:42,036
and that's prime you want to welcome
them

56
00:03:42,063 --> 00:03:45,065
it's so important that their first
experience

57
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:50,156
is a good one because otherwise it's
gonna be their last six grams you've got

58
00:03:51,056 --> 00:03:53,122
a million other competitors in the App
Store literally

59
00:03:54,022 --> 00:03:57,098
for people are gonna stick around if if
the first experience for them

60
00:03:57,098 --> 00:04:00,183
really great now when you step into a

61
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:04,178
store there's like in at like a physical
store in real life

62
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,122
earth there's a number things are gonna
influence whether or not you stick

63
00:04:09,022 --> 00:04:09,028
around

64
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:12,155
already turn around and walk out you
know if the

65
00:04:13,055 --> 00:04:16,584
layup by the store intimidating her or
is inviting

66
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:20,097
here's the staff rude as the staff

67
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:23,262
really aggressively percy

68
00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:26,290
those things could turn you off to make
you walk away

69
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:30,380
but if the staff is inviting and the
environment comfortable

70
00:04:30,038 --> 00:04:34,090
well you might the crown explore the
merchandise

71
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:37,014
so the best approach with after game

72
00:04:38,004 --> 00:04:42,095
is that you want to get people and using
them as quickly as possible

73
00:04:43,031 --> 00:04:47,114
you just wanna jack but people jump
right in and sometimes that's not always

74
00:04:48,014 --> 00:04:51,037
possible now

75
00:04:51,037 --> 00:04:54,054
her number recent for having onboarding
and having

76
00:04:54,054 --> 00:04:57,058
a confusing or poorly executed you I

77
00:04:57,058 --> 00:05:02,119
is not one of them for you wanna make
sure if your UI is an intuitive

78
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:07,025
an easy to use spend time are finding
that why

79
00:05:07,025 --> 00:05:10,113
not building an onboarding sequence okay

80
00:05:11,013 --> 00:05:15,084
now if you have registration required to
use your application

81
00:05:15,084 --> 00:05:18,089
that's a different story

82
00:05:19,034 --> 00:05:22,117
or where should game

83
00:05:23,017 --> 00:05:26,052
you might need to explain the back story
or the rule you know how

84
00:05:26,052 --> 00:05:29,083
how games are played or if your UI

85
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:33,092
heavily reliant on gestures that might
warrant a little bit of information in

86
00:05:33,092 --> 00:05:35,097
order to get started

87
00:05:35,097 --> 00:05:40,101
so let's stop beef briefly but if you're
too require registration

88
00:05:41,037 --> 00:05:44,101
sometimes that is absolutely necessary
to see anything

89
00:05:45,001 --> 00:05:48,006
banking application or source on that
were

90
00:05:48,051 --> 00:05:52,104
for bill pay anything that have personal
information

91
00:05:53,004 --> 00:05:57,028
then you're gonna need to to let people
now what's going on

92
00:05:57,028 --> 00:06:00,032
but before

93
00:06:00,032 --> 00:06:03,096
if there's any way possible you wanted
to lay that registration and took

94
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:06,120
absolutely necessary

95
00:06:07,002 --> 00:06:11,083
now that I can store is a great example
Beth you can browse and look at all the

96
00:06:12,001 --> 00:06:15,025
books in the music and the movies that
you want

97
00:06:15,025 --> 00:06:18,036
and it's only when you go to buy
something

98
00:06:18,036 --> 00:06:21,082
you need to authenticate or register

99
00:06:21,082 --> 00:06:25,123
this means there's nothing standing in
the way of finding something you love

100
00:06:26,023 --> 00:06:29,025
requiring people to register before they
can see anything put forth

101
00:06:29,043 --> 00:06:32,054
unnecessary obstacle in their way

102
00:06:32,054 --> 00:06:35,065
they have to trust that it's going to be
worth their while to go through that

103
00:06:35,065 --> 00:06:37,084
obstacle

104
00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:42,600
here is a better way this is Duque at
the concert finding out

105
00:06:42,006 --> 00:06:45,575
they've got a great design that will
help you find concert fair

106
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:50,870
local to you tailored to your case they
were even find someone to go to the

107
00:06:50,087 --> 00:06:51,166
concert with you

108
00:06:52,066 --> 00:06:55,070
now not only do they have a very short
onboarding sequence

109
00:06:55,007 --> 00:06:58,099
but you they will let you browse without
registering

110
00:06:59,062 --> 00:07:02,581
at all you just cap that skip this

111
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:07,500
for now text at the bottom and you can
go right inside and explore what the app

112
00:07:07,005 --> 00:07:08,062
is all about

113
00:07:09,007 --> 00:07:12,069
you can look at the concert listings
read about band

114
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:15,123
and it's only when you express interest
in something are you want a parking

115
00:07:16,023 --> 00:07:16,118
ticket

116
00:07:17,018 --> 00:07:20,087
well that's when they have you ask you
to find out

117
00:07:20,087 --> 00:07:25,096
and that's great this approach lets you
see what happens all about

118
00:07:25,096 --> 00:07:28,129
you can explore everything all the
concert in your area

119
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:34,057
and you only have to register when
you're ready to take action on something

120
00:07:34,057 --> 00:07:37,152
people are going to be much more
motivated and quite frankly comfortable

121
00:07:38,052 --> 00:07:40,103
going through that registration process

122
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:44,061
if they're confident and the quality and
the utility

123
00:07:44,061 --> 00:07:47,150
what your app is offering them

124
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:51,930
now wanna time to have people go through
that registration

125
00:07:51,093 --> 00:07:56,582
you wanna explain why you're asking them
to register

126
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:01,440
so think about it this way let's say a
stranger walked up to you in front of

127
00:08:01,044 --> 00:08:02,140
Moscone and fed hay

128
00:08:03,004 --> 00:08:06,019
can I have your email address and phone
number you

129
00:08:06,055 --> 00:08:09,674
%um give a damn right it's just creepy
and you've no idea what's going to

130
00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:11,090
happen

131
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:14,105
with that data now that's exactly

132
00:08:15,005 --> 00:08:19,006
what you're doing if you ask people to
register but you're not telling them why

133
00:08:19,006 --> 00:08:22,007
and they don't know anything about you

134
00:08:22,007 --> 00:08:25,059
it's especially important in cases where

135
00:08:25,059 --> 00:08:28,097
you have to register in order to use an
app

136
00:08:28,097 --> 00:08:32,516
because your description in the App
Store or word-of-mouth

137
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:37,940
or brand awareness isn't enough to make
people feel comfortable giving you all

138
00:08:37,094 --> 00:08:39,573
of their personal information

139
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:44,970
you need to make it really clear what
you're gonna do with that

140
00:08:44,097 --> 00:08:48,172
so this is jelly and they crowd fourth
answer three questions from your social

141
00:08:49,072 --> 00:08:50,181
network

142
00:08:50,829 --> 00:08:53,865
so they have a real challenge take it
there really is nothing they can show

143
00:08:54,189 --> 00:08:56,233
you what are you registering and finding
an

144
00:08:56,629 --> 00:08:59,643
so that's why they've given you this
brief explanation

145
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:05,110
what the service is about and explain
why they need your information

146
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:08,720
and very importantly they let you know
that they're not gonna post anything

147
00:09:08,819 --> 00:09:12,600
automatic way and this is very important

148
00:09:12,006 --> 00:09:15,245
because when you're dealing with people

149
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,990
personal information you want to make
sure that they're comfortable

150
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:23,160
giving it to you they wanna know that
you're gonna protect their privacy thing

151
00:09:24,006 --> 00:09:27,595
and transparency around privacy is
particularly important

152
00:09:28,189 --> 00:09:32,190
if you're dealing with social network
integration if I'm sure we've all had

153
00:09:32,199 --> 00:09:32,230
that

154
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:37,290
friends that you've got some after going
crazy on their time line you're thinking

155
00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:38,031
of what a new

156
00:09:38,049 --> 00:09:41,808
you know nobody checkers that aims they
didn't know what they were doing

157
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:46,302
and nowhere is this more the case when
you're dealing with dating application

158
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:52,410
because I would be a nightmare of an all
your friends your family and from people

159
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,041
the Econo from worker

160
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:57,043
met some time at a bar kit fee very
alike

161
00:09:57,043 --> 00:10:00,802
and he didn't like nobody wants fat

162
00:10:01,189 --> 00:10:05,720
so tender here very popular dating
application and they're very

163
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:09,041
worth it they are never gonna post
anything

164
00:10:09,689 --> 00:10:14,350
to face back on your behalf and this is
hugely important because the way that

165
00:10:14,035 --> 00:10:16,274
tender works is there asking year

166
00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:19,594
if you like people based on their
picture

167
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:23,660
so if you have any doubts at all are you
feeling a little have the 10

168
00:10:23,066 --> 00:10:27,068
you can tap that I but and they spell it
out in more detail

169
00:10:27,086 --> 00:10:31,655
they take your primary privacy very
seriously

170
00:10:32,429 --> 00:10:35,980
they're never gonna post on Facebook for
you they're not going to give away your

171
00:10:35,098 --> 00:10:36,637
location

172
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,110
for people can feel reassured more
comfortable

173
00:10:41,011 --> 00:10:45,790
and nowhere is this privacy gonna be
more important than with your social

174
00:10:45,889 --> 00:10:47,903
integration

175
00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:51,740
now I'm just giving you a whole lot of
advice about things to tell people

176
00:10:51,074 --> 00:10:52,147
before they register

177
00:10:53,047 --> 00:10:56,476
but I want to encourage you that when
you're telling them I love the thing

178
00:10:56,899 --> 00:11:00,947
be for Frank be out for things as
possible

179
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:04,800
we all know that people don't like to
read long passes

180
00:11:04,008 --> 00:11:07,287
passages attacks on a nap 8 tap tap
tapping it going

181
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,104
now whoever does a great job with this
if you haven't experienced

182
00:11:12,329 --> 00:11:15,420
over yet in San Francisco it is a a

183
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:19,451
it's a car service for the %ah come pick
you up I like a taxi

184
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:22,600
and you might think well why do I have
to give them a email address and phone

185
00:11:22,006 --> 00:11:23,013
number

186
00:11:23,067 --> 00:11:26,096
just in order to get a ride from A to B

187
00:11:26,699 --> 00:11:30,724
and at they explain here very briefly

188
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:34,740
they're gonna offend you notifications
about when the car coming

189
00:11:34,074 --> 00:11:40,213
an email about the confirmation for that
makes you feel better

190
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:45,600
fell being for things will keep your
registration process or

191
00:11:45,006 --> 00:11:49,035
and it will help encourage people
actually read the taxpayers so carefully

192
00:11:49,629 --> 00:11:49,724
crafted

193
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:55,410
for that spring now another way that you
can make the process shortest

194
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:59,086
only collect what you need right now

195
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:02,091
don't be tempted to ask for a lot of
information could you have this great

196
00:12:03,036 --> 00:12:06,245
featured you're probably gonna do it
someday or

197
00:12:06,569 --> 00:12:09,860
maybe you're thinking about doing that
so let's get data birth and life after

198
00:12:09,086 --> 00:12:10,179
gender and

199
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:14,618
you only wanna take what it is that
you're going to use

200
00:12:15,329 --> 00:12:18,373
and what you've told the users that
you're gonna do with it so that people

201
00:12:18,769 --> 00:12:19,774
feel comfortable

202
00:12:19,819 --> 00:12:23,160
giving it to you other wire

203
00:12:23,016 --> 00:12:26,375
people are going to be suspicious and
that could prevent them from actually

204
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:30,541
going through the registration process

205
00:12:30,739 --> 00:12:35,300
fell if you do you need people to
register in order to use your ass

206
00:12:35,003 --> 00:12:38,102
keep these things in mind follow these
guidelines on everyone's gonna feel

207
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:41,058
really comfortable and motivated

208
00:12:41,319 --> 00:12:44,319
to give you their information

209
00:12:44,319 --> 00:12:50,330
alright for now let's get into the
onboarding best practices

210
00:12:50,429 --> 00:12:53,670
as I said earlier the bath

211
00:12:53,067 --> 00:12:56,926
experience it's gonna be a just jump in
and start using that app

212
00:12:57,529 --> 00:13:00,577
right away for you one after South

213
00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:05,041
what people need to know in order to get
started with my app

214
00:13:05,329 --> 00:13:09,220
and if the answer is nothing fantastic

215
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:14,611
dope any onboarding and your great just
let a man and let them get going

216
00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:17,892
now if there are something like the rule
for game

217
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,720
or like a gesture that they might need
to know

218
00:13:21,072 --> 00:13:25,079
you want to tell them just enough to get
started and then get out of the way

219
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:27,080
quickly

220
00:13:27,008 --> 00:13:30,039
so think about if you went into a
restaurant

221
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:35,790
and before you sat down at the table the
host that okay welcomes the rough trot

222
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:38,896
I'm gonna tell you everything off and on
the menu right now

223
00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:44,590
in great detail and by the way here are
the things that I think you should order

224
00:13:44,689 --> 00:13:47,715
I would be ridiculous right so pretty

225
00:13:47,949 --> 00:13:51,910
really just wanna come and get federal
to your table peruse the menu at your

226
00:13:51,091 --> 00:13:52,430
leisure

227
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:57,313
acting experience for your after right
so that's where you need to recreate in

228
00:13:57,889 --> 00:13:58,720
your app

229
00:13:58,072 --> 00:14:03,091
for your game you wanna do that ok well
and I've leading people into their table

230
00:14:03,091 --> 00:14:06,330
tell maybe you're gonna tell them the
specials in a restaurant

231
00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:10,410
and then let them explore on their own

232
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:13,270
when people launch an app or game

233
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:18,670
they're expecting for part if the pay
they're not expecting a long lecture

234
00:14:18,067 --> 00:14:22,786
so a match then matching you launch
calculator app and you saw something

235
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:26,477
like that

236
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:30,361
followed by this

237
00:14:31,189 --> 00:14:35,208
followed by this oh my gosh now I'm not
gonna make you guys sector of seven

238
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:36,480
apiece but

239
00:14:36,048 --> 00:14:40,807
you can he how frustrating that would be
if you're faced with a long list of

240
00:14:41,239 --> 00:14:43,253
marketing messages about an hour

241
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:47,380
before you even got to you that I mean
it's calculator right

242
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:50,600
they're really resist the temptation

243
00:14:50,006 --> 00:14:54,975
to strings together a whole lot along
with SIV features and marketing and hey

244
00:14:55,569 --> 00:14:57,720
make sure you check this thing out

245
00:14:57,072 --> 00:15:02,151
people want to get in and get going
there is no need for instruction

246
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:05,970
if the user interface is intuitive two
years

247
00:15:05,097 --> 00:15:09,196
and the functionality is obvious and if
it isn't

248
00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:14,074
I should just that spend time reworking
the divine

249
00:15:14,119 --> 00:15:19,126
not thinking about tomorrow morning
screens on their

250
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:22,824
if you need to give a few I fared you
wanna do it quickly and get out of the

251
00:15:23,319 --> 00:15:24,324
way but otherwise

252
00:15:24,369 --> 00:15:29,372
avoid those long marketing methods is OK

253
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:32,424
now you always want to start with the
basics

254
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:35,728
and this is especially important for
games which are most often the place we

255
00:15:36,439 --> 00:15:39,454
need a little information to get going

256
00:15:39,589 --> 00:15:43,606
like with video games with our app for
game you might want the backstory

257
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,770
so you know you know what's the
objective of the game are the back story

258
00:15:46,869 --> 00:15:46,951
makes for more fun

259
00:15:47,689 --> 00:15:52,410
right but think about a card game that
you sit down to play with friends

260
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:57,260
first usually go over okay what are the
rule how to play progress how do you win

261
00:15:57,629 --> 00:16:00,631
abt important one and then you might
even try

262
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:04,704
a couple tips on strategy all before you
start playing

263
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,790
so just like a card game you start with
the basics

264
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,188
and then you build up the complexity
from there

265
00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:14,966
because you're not be prepared to learn
about strategies for weighing if you

266
00:16:15,569 --> 00:16:18,667
don't understand how the game is played
in first place

267
00:16:19,549 --> 00:16:22,556
but forget a great example of this is
dot

268
00:16:22,619 --> 00:16:27,600
doctor the puzzle game any just a little
bit upon boarding to explain how the

269
00:16:27,006 --> 00:16:28,455
game works

270
00:16:29,049 --> 00:16:32,057
and they've also touched on the
inspiration up for the game they've got

271
00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:33,161
this quote here

272
00:16:33,449 --> 00:16:36,484
smart man one fat everything offense
like act mmm

273
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:39,858
okay for the first thank you got

274
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:43,420
connect them got it

275
00:16:43,042 --> 00:16:47,045
now a couple more got

276
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:50,811
now different colors the top wall

277
00:16:51,459 --> 00:16:56,490
wall wall you'll

278
00:16:56,769 --> 00:16:59,776
pretty basic but they're building up the
compact see if you go

279
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,845
and they're reinforcing everything was
found in animation

280
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:07,918
positive reassurance that you're going
through so it is completely interactive

281
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:11,610
for that that's a great way to get
started

282
00:17:11,061 --> 00:17:14,073
and now I know that the seems like a
pretty simple

283
00:17:14,073 --> 00:17:19,077
example but really almost anyhow game
benefit from that builders role playing

284
00:17:19,077 --> 00:17:21,516
games arcade games all that

285
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:26,980
but take a look at him and go now at him
and go have eliminated on morning

286
00:17:26,098 --> 00:17:29,145
altogether it doesn't put you in the
game right away

287
00:17:30,045 --> 00:17:33,108
a great experience but to fat people a
person

288
00:17:34,008 --> 00:17:37,077
six path the very basic level of

289
00:17:37,149 --> 00:17:41,186
start the first level that you play
start with very basic accent

290
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,760
so what's the first thing you need to
know in order to play this game

291
00:17:44,076 --> 00:17:47,605
what how to move and and how to win

292
00:17:48,289 --> 00:17:54,352
right okay we got a straight line I only
have one choice

293
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:58,610
are one more choice

294
00:17:58,061 --> 00:18:03,340
her a fix have I mean it was very easy
it's a no-lose situation

295
00:18:03,889 --> 00:18:06,952
but that teaching you what's the
objective I want to get that big dark

296
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:08,598
circle at the end of the screen right

297
00:18:09,309 --> 00:18:13,760
how do I move along the path

298
00:18:13,076 --> 00:18:19,108
next phase introduce you obstacle

299
00:18:20,008 --> 00:18:23,457
again got one path and I'm a hit man

300
00:18:23,529 --> 00:18:27,100
and this guys back up towards me thou

301
00:18:27,001 --> 00:18:32,090
here is a pretty easy target I

302
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:35,195
again if I can't leave level but I'm
playing the game and I'm learning as I

303
00:18:36,095 --> 00:18:36,150
go

304
00:18:37,005 --> 00:18:41,934
so it's fun it's not morning I'm playing
a game here

305
00:18:42,429 --> 00:18:46,434
now at the level for graph a get more
difficult you get toys in your path and

306
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:51,190
now you're obstacle here facing years
that's going to be a little trickier

307
00:18:51,019 --> 00:18:55,072
and trust me get much much harder get
different kinds of obstacles

308
00:18:55,072 --> 00:18:58,137
more them trapped or things like that

309
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:03,037
when you first start playing all you
have to do its complete the level

310
00:19:03,037 --> 00:19:06,109
get to that dark circle of the an

311
00:19:07,009 --> 00:19:11,468
but the more you play more challenges
you have for now I'm not just

312
00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:14,550
completing Level and you collect the
brief K

313
00:19:14,649 --> 00:19:18,370
I gonna do it 12 move for last last

314
00:19:18,037 --> 00:19:21,110
getting more complex missus giving me
more QE

315
00:19:22,001 --> 00:19:26,027
more challenges and it's encouraging
repeat gameplay flop

316
00:19:26,036 --> 00:19:31,036
recovery view to start on this level Hui
I think that would last all about

317
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:35,060
30 FAC and from the night be off to find
another game

318
00:19:35,006 --> 00:19:39,315
now starting them play and building up
the complexity is called scaffolding

319
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:44,920
and that's how you can set up new
players have an enjoyable experience

320
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:50,220
gonna keep them coming back to your game
but this approach also worked her ass as

321
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,023
well

322
00:19:51,032 --> 00:19:54,119
you want to teach the basic thing how to
navigate and the general purpose

323
00:19:55,019 --> 00:19:55,085
function

324
00:19:55,085 --> 00:19:58,154
before even Confederate trying to teach
people

325
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:03,570
about more advanced operations

326
00:20:03,057 --> 00:20:07,057
now this is Yahoo News tight ass since
one of this year's Apple Design Award

327
00:20:07,057 --> 00:20:08,060
winner

328
00:20:08,087 --> 00:20:11,112
now they've got a fantastic you I have
might have gas

329
00:20:12,012 --> 00:20:15,034
by their ward its intuitive two years so

330
00:20:15,034 --> 00:20:19,613
not appear on boarding at covering you
are

331
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,943
now the way that that's news works is
that it's a daily digest

332
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:27,500
twice a day and this is an entirely new
paradigm for Yahoo News

333
00:20:27,005 --> 00:20:31,934
had quite an established audience that
was really important for fat people

334
00:20:32,429 --> 00:20:36,720
expectations about the content that they
were going to be seen

335
00:20:36,072 --> 00:20:39,119
otherwise people might be confused
throughout the purpose of the app

336
00:20:40,019 --> 00:20:45,738
so by putting together just three short
screams with a supportive illustration

337
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:50,200
and then getting the right answer the
news they're setting you up for success

338
00:20:50,002 --> 00:20:54,056
in a different kind away and this
approach is not appropriate for all

339
00:20:54,074 --> 00:20:56,113
kinds of after games

340
00:20:56,779 --> 00:20:59,843
it's really when you're breaking into a
new market or the earth abducting from

341
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:01,424
sort a new paradigm

342
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,980
that you might need to communicate just
a little bit about your pork on Feb

343
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:09,124
and that's going to help people
understand the product and quite frankly

344
00:21:10,024 --> 00:21:11,123
appreciate it right

345
00:21:12,023 --> 00:21:15,044
for just three short screams and then
getting at you enter the news cuz

346
00:21:15,044 --> 00:21:18,393
they're gonna get out the way quickly

347
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:21,864
so think about the basic basic things
that people would need for now

348
00:21:22,539 --> 00:21:26,570
in order to start playing your game are
using your app and think about

349
00:21:26,057 --> 00:21:31,046
if any of them really need explaining
because again if you don't

350
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:35,460
if they don't don't do any onboarding
right but if you do

351
00:21:35,046 --> 00:21:38,046
can consider the way that you can start
based

352
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:41,110
with the basics and bill that the
complexity with games it's going to be

353
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:42,830
had a mere

354
00:21:42,929 --> 00:21:47,740
what the object at howdy when in fact
that

355
00:21:47,074 --> 00:21:51,233
and when you're teaching me thing make
sure you're only teaching one

356
00:21:51,899 --> 00:21:56,710
thing at a time it is so much harder to
our never doubt whether

357
00:21:56,071 --> 00:21:59,250
financial construction that Juan orbit a
freshly

358
00:21:59,889 --> 00:22:03,580
its related to something unfamiliar
right okay I'm gonna give all the guy

359
00:22:03,058 --> 00:22:05,063
from instruction

360
00:22:06,008 --> 00:22:09,008
after their I want to leave Mosconi

361
00:22:09,008 --> 00:22:12,217
make you left turn better write down the
alleyway

362
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:15,980
go to the coffee shop on the corner
order to lock a

363
00:22:15,098 --> 00:22:18,112
1d cast one low-fat

364
00:22:19,012 --> 00:22:22,100
but three sugars in the decathlon and
one sugar in the low fat one and bring

365
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,659
them back to me here

366
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:30,980
got it and if anyone got that i'm
looking for to my locker after that

367
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:34,547
but but you can see how difficult that
is I'm sure you guys all turned out on

368
00:22:35,429 --> 00:22:37,070
Feb 3

369
00:22:37,007 --> 00:22:41,045
people are going to be much more able to
follow those instructions if they're

370
00:22:41,045 --> 00:22:43,494
parceled out one at a time

371
00:22:43,899 --> 00:22:47,938
self I fed go item of going make to have
turned and then

372
00:22:48,289 --> 00:22:52,120
when you get to the corner of how you
what to do and that of a go to the

373
00:22:52,012 --> 00:22:53,088
coffee shop

374
00:22:53,088 --> 00:22:56,134
and then when you get to the register i
text you hey here's the coffee

375
00:22:57,034 --> 00:23:02,070
but I want you to order you this would
be so much easier

376
00:23:02,007 --> 00:23:05,976
see you want to give instructions one at
a time and give people a chance to apply

377
00:23:06,669 --> 00:23:10,850
those instructions before you start
teaching anything else

378
00:23:10,085 --> 00:23:13,161
so this is Leo 4chan another one of our
Apple Design Award winners

379
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:18,160
from the fear it up really fun platform
adventure game

380
00:23:19,006 --> 00:23:22,057
that in these really gorgeous
environment and

381
00:23:23,011 --> 00:23:27,050
their tutorial eva is fantastic they

382
00:23:27,149 --> 00:23:30,200
first start explain the game with a
little bit a backstory they introduce

383
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:31,683
you to Leopold

384
00:23:31,899 --> 00:23:37,090
they let you know if losses 4chan and
you're gonna help him reclaim it

385
00:23:37,009 --> 00:23:40,060
so this translates into you get the gold
coins

386
00:23:40,006 --> 00:23:44,435
now you got your objective right next
Sat if just

387
00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:50,031
about how to hold your device they're
getting used to this idea that the last

388
00:23:50,049 --> 00:23:51,070
fire screen

389
00:23:51,007 --> 00:23:54,336
and the right phone screen are gonna do
something different

390
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:58,250
but they haven't told you what that is
yet just put your thumbs and this

391
00:23:58,025 --> 00:24:00,574
position and that gets you holding the
device eg

392
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:05,580
in the bath way now once you press your
company

393
00:24:05,058 --> 00:24:08,107
or call then they're talking about
movement what do you do with your life

394
00:24:09,007 --> 00:24:09,072
span

395
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:12,611
well first we're just gonna go forwards
and backwards

396
00:24:13,259 --> 00:24:17,351
very basic fact and then you get a
chance to play without a little bit you

397
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:22,241
gonna collect from car and go there some
other cool environment

398
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,812
and then a flight obstacle now

399
00:24:25,929 --> 00:24:29,250
there's a little chop trying to help you
out or some words on the right that lets

400
00:24:29,025 --> 00:24:29,534
you know

401
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:33,700
now it's time you can use your right
time here we go

402
00:24:33,007 --> 00:24:36,015
get up over that lives and then

403
00:24:37,005 --> 00:24:40,006
a chance to play they give you things to
jump over

404
00:24:40,006 --> 00:24:43,805
thanks to jump on fair and next up

405
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:48,404
some more obstacles here it's about
using that up gesture for something out

406
00:24:48,899 --> 00:24:54,200
so they're building up the complexity
while teaching one thing at a time

407
00:24:54,002 --> 00:24:57,191
pushing up on that lever is going to
release the drawbridge

408
00:24:57,389 --> 00:25:01,820
and then you can continue on your way
then you learn about pushing down and

409
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:04,086
what that that for you

410
00:25:05,022 --> 00:25:08,121
earlier fourth-and-1 scale other time
which is so mad small

411
00:25:09,021 --> 00:25:12,024
and have fun because you're playing so

412
00:25:12,024 --> 00:25:15,963
it's a great example of scaffolding
along with him mango

413
00:25:16,179 --> 00:25:19,870
and several other examples

414
00:25:19,087 --> 00:25:25,776
so the first thing you do you if you are
in the objective collectors gold coins

415
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,645
next thing you're gonna learn about if
optimal ham possession right for their

416
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:34,370
building up the complexity with the
scaffolding

417
00:25:34,037 --> 00:25:37,084
and the next thing that you learn about
as really basic movement

418
00:25:37,084 --> 00:25:41,173
how to go forward what are you doing
with your left hand

419
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:46,122
next up is obstacle which you conquer
using your right hand in various

420
00:25:47,022 --> 00:25:48,024
gestures

421
00:25:48,024 --> 00:25:52,085
and then further in the game they start
selling your advanced obstacles are part

422
00:25:52,085 --> 00:25:52,090
of

423
00:25:53,035 --> 00:25:57,083
you can see how the complexity built up
that way

424
00:25:57,083 --> 00:26:00,802
now like I said the same thing applies
to ap stats not just games

425
00:26:01,549 --> 00:26:04,632
you can teach people by doing you don't
wanna show them a lot of screens that

426
00:26:05,379 --> 00:26:06,454
front

427
00:26:07,129 --> 00:26:11,134
now penned for a the first entrapped and
they onboarding just for specific

428
00:26:11,629 --> 00:26:11,722
feature

429
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,590
so they have a new Guided Search feature
and

430
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:19,083
they needed to teach people near the
Afghan also returning user

431
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:23,422
how do you how to go about using it may
do a great job apart going out this

432
00:26:24,169 --> 00:26:26,243
information one step at a time

433
00:26:26,909 --> 00:26:29,960
for the first time you go to the search
tab after the feature was introduced to

434
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:32,440
get a little bit of information

435
00:26:32,629 --> 00:26:35,721
and a given you some sample of and the
fam both are all things that I'm pretty

436
00:26:36,549 --> 00:26:37,549
interested and

437
00:26:37,549 --> 00:26:41,730
so they've done a great job in making
this a really valuable exercise

438
00:26:41,073 --> 00:26:44,159
for me now I happen to like nail art

439
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:49,097
and Sonax I tap they explain to me how
to refine that starts

440
00:26:49,097 --> 00:26:53,123
even further

441
00:26:54,023 --> 00:26:57,962
and then 15 down for find that they talk
about even more advanced for five at

442
00:26:58,169 --> 00:27:03,840
free typing an because you're getting
this information one step at a time

443
00:27:03,084 --> 00:27:07,303
it's much easier to understand what to
do and they're letting you execute on

444
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:09,200
these instructions

445
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:12,005
so you're really learning you're taking
it all in

446
00:27:12,023 --> 00:27:15,462
you're much more likely to remember this
later next time you get a first for

447
00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:19,480
something

448
00:27:19,048 --> 00:27:23,084
with all of these examples it was an
overwhelming right

449
00:27:23,084 --> 00:27:26,120
and you're actually able to use what
you've learned because you're playing

450
00:27:27,002 --> 00:27:31,361
the game are using an app

451
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:34,592
because people learn better i doing

452
00:27:34,889 --> 00:27:41,070
than they do by reading or listening
when it comes to App Store games

453
00:27:41,007 --> 00:27:45,070
dot hit man go leo's fortune they all
reinforce what they're teaching you

454
00:27:45,007 --> 00:27:45,836
replay

455
00:27:46,529 --> 00:27:49,618
and Pinterest letting you actually first
for things they want and i cant

456
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:54,506
experienced those were real thirst terms
with real refinement

457
00:27:55,289 --> 00:28:00,090
so even though this is there really
super easy can't lease level

458
00:28:00,009 --> 00:28:07,009
on him and go

459
00:28:10,509 --> 00:28:16,720
it's a lot more fun then this would be
right

460
00:28:16,072 --> 00:28:19,109
now benjamin Franklin have a great quote
about this

461
00:28:20,009 --> 00:28:23,023
tell me and I forget teach me and I
remember

462
00:28:23,023 --> 00:28:26,972
involve me and i learn that's where you
want to avoid

463
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:32,080
screenshot from low to display anything
it's gonna take you out a contact to

464
00:28:32,008 --> 00:28:32,737
prevent you from

465
00:28:32,809 --> 00:28:38,490
actually using the app or game isn't
going to be effective

466
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:41,598
again what if this was the experience
with calculator

467
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:46,098
it would be terrible right first evolved
you are so damn you can barely feel

468
00:28:46,629 --> 00:28:46,950
about

469
00:28:46,095 --> 00:28:50,122
at all secondly you don't need to faye

470
00:28:51,022 --> 00:28:54,048
tap here tap here tap here all over a
catch

471
00:28:54,048 --> 00:28:59,747
interface its attach interface you tap
my biggest pet peeve is when I see click

472
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:00,740
here

473
00:29:00,074 --> 00:29:05,263
on it on touch devices for that really
gets me

474
00:29:05,929 --> 00:29:10,620
now again if your buttons don't look
obviously interactive

475
00:29:10,062 --> 00:29:13,241
redesign your butt don't pick from Notre

476
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:18,807
way letting you know that you can tap
places

477
00:29:18,879 --> 00:29:22,905
so if you do need onboarding make sure
that your experience let people protest

478
00:29:23,139 --> 00:29:25,730
Bay

479
00:29:25,073 --> 00:29:30,109
and you can use animation to do a lot of
teaching at it's a really powerful tool

480
00:29:31,009 --> 00:29:34,208
there's a lot of great information about
the craft of animation

481
00:29:34,289 --> 00:29:38,490
and Q se designing intuitive interfaces
sessions if you don't

482
00:29:38,049 --> 00:29:41,135
fear fashion check out the video it's
available

483
00:29:42,035 --> 00:29:46,344
for today I would just like to talk
specifically about something that I've

484
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:47,670
seen games

485
00:29:47,769 --> 00:29:50,823
all the time its giant

486
00:29:51,309 --> 00:29:54,950
bouncing a row

487
00:29:54,095 --> 00:29:58,424
now I'm first this does seem like an
effective way to get people through

488
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,280
tutorial level

489
00:30:01,379 --> 00:30:05,360
great but then know what

490
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:08,133
starts to show people where to look
eventually become

491
00:30:09,033 --> 00:30:12,862
distracting when there's more
information on the screen you're not

492
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:14,233
looking at the information

493
00:30:14,899 --> 00:30:17,975
you're just looking at the Aero and word
attack and thinking I want to play the

494
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:20,480
game I don't want to read the tutorial

495
00:30:20,048 --> 00:30:25,317
fair looking at this button and federal
looking at what the different characters

496
00:30:25,749 --> 00:30:26,787
are gonna do for you

497
00:30:27,129 --> 00:30:30,142
wire picking them the strategy the game

498
00:30:30,259 --> 00:30:33,286
or how much it's going to cost you what
the reward is gonna be

499
00:30:33,529 --> 00:30:37,190
for pretty fair your game have gone from

500
00:30:37,019 --> 00:30:40,508
you know happy ice cream fun time or
whatever

501
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:44,620
to cap a row no one wants to play tap
the arrow

502
00:30:44,062 --> 00:30:48,071
up our fun game tafero gets old

503
00:30:48,071 --> 00:30:52,270
so quickly another way kinda thing
coveted I don't know how many view

504
00:30:52,909 --> 00:30:56,947
had but if you've ever tried to point
something out to a dog or cat

505
00:30:57,289 --> 00:31:04,289
they often just want help looking at
your finger right here

506
00:31:05,649 --> 00:31:10,820
I so this is exactly what you're doing
with tap the arrow

507
00:31:10,082 --> 00:31:13,120
people are going to be looking at what
you're pointing toward for gonna be

508
00:31:14,002 --> 00:31:15,211
looking at the Aero

509
00:31:15,409 --> 00:31:18,474
fell rather than pointing try

510
00:31:19,059 --> 00:31:22,133
suggestive animation one that's gonna
help you read people fight for the right

511
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:23,810
part of the screen

512
00:31:23,909 --> 00:31:28,850
or let them know what they should dare
really basic example but it's a good one

513
00:31:28,085 --> 00:31:31,504
with hit mango you don't need in a row
or

514
00:31:32,269 --> 00:31:35,367
a graph a record some other kinda about
the air afsane to let you know that this

515
00:31:36,249 --> 00:31:37,220
is a button

516
00:31:37,022 --> 00:31:41,085
in addition to being the name that whole
thing animation draws me to you it makes

517
00:31:41,085 --> 00:31:43,136
you wanna tap it right

518
00:31:44,036 --> 00:31:48,070
may could have had an arrow pointing cap
here to have here

519
00:31:48,007 --> 00:31:51,226
but you don't need to do that

520
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,977
about putting me about using animation
thoughtful way

521
00:31:55,499 --> 00:32:00,690
I hope I look forward to seeing far
fewer bouncing errors in the future

522
00:32:00,069 --> 00:32:03,188
now if you do need your on boarding
another thing

523
00:32:03,809 --> 00:32:07,865
and to keep be wary at is there is no
need to point out

524
00:32:08,369 --> 00:32:12,434
any platform convention you only point
out the unconventional

525
00:32:13,019 --> 00:32:18,095
because everybody knows there's another
screen app icons available on the folder

526
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:22,813
the paging got take care of that for you
you don't you want me to put a narrower

527
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:25,210
syntax says slide to the side to see
more icon

528
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:29,350
be ridiculous similar way

529
00:32:29,035 --> 00:32:32,084
you don't have to tell people that tab
bar and toolbar

530
00:32:32,084 --> 00:32:35,173
our interactive they instinctively look
that way

531
00:32:36,073 --> 00:32:40,242
or that you can swipe for more content
because the content waiting off the edge

532
00:32:40,899 --> 00:32:44,440
doubt that job for you and that's really

533
00:32:44,044 --> 00:32:48,283
one of the greatest advance says:
everything platform convention

534
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:52,190
people just instinctively know how to
interact with them

535
00:32:52,019 --> 00:32:55,045
you won't need any onboarding for these
type of thing

536
00:32:55,045 --> 00:32:58,046
you only want to point out anything that
def Teenz

537
00:32:58,046 --> 00:33:01,123
and unique an unfamiliar to your
audience

538
00:33:02,023 --> 00:33:05,212
now another thing to be wary a is

539
00:33:05,419 --> 00:33:09,490
forcing people to go down a secondary
path that they may not wanna take

540
00:33:09,049 --> 00:33:12,948
so think about a photo application

541
00:33:13,389 --> 00:33:16,980
I don't want to be forced to crop it a
match if I don't think it needs to be

542
00:33:16,098 --> 00:33:17,099
crops

543
00:33:18,008 --> 00:33:21,070
I don't want to apply a photo filter 24
to a photo

544
00:33:21,007 --> 00:33:26,021
I shouldn't have to you this is my happy
I want to do what I want that

545
00:33:26,084 --> 00:33:30,123
similarly with music application it's
great to show people how to make a play

546
00:33:31,023 --> 00:33:31,552
with

547
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:36,940
earth station but don't make the market
a favorite if if not a favorite

548
00:33:36,094 --> 00:33:39,157
it's just frustrating

549
00:33:40,057 --> 00:33:45,416
know when it comes to tax like I said
before sorter is always better

550
00:33:45,929 --> 00:33:49,340
we know that people are not inclined to
read really long passages

551
00:33:49,034 --> 00:33:54,243
must have the book fell make sure your
language is short

552
00:33:54,549 --> 00:33:57,574
and career avoid jargon and

553
00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:01,820
Akron am or in fighter language that may
not make sense for someone who's near

554
00:34:02,009 --> 00:34:04,047
your apt okay

555
00:34:04,389 --> 00:34:08,790
this is my favorite example I've Duque
and they're talking about their

556
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,154
notification

557
00:34:11,054 --> 00:34:16,099
it so fun a mixtape from a stalker I'm
excited

558
00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:19,145
yeah I mean this this Texas clear

559
00:34:20,045 --> 00:34:26,063
its friendly its entertaining as well as
being educational

560
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:29,121
so here's some things you can think
about when it comes to writing your tax

561
00:34:30,021 --> 00:34:34,046
after southeast question could detect
three shorter

562
00:34:34,046 --> 00:34:40,075
could be clear will the tax make sense
to someone who is new to the application

563
00:34:40,075 --> 00:34:43,254
because you look at your apt all day and
all night

564
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:47,500
every day for you really need fresh
perspective and

565
00:34:47,005 --> 00:34:51,061
and what what someone unfamiliar with
your app thank

566
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:56,054
if the methods to complicate if it is

567
00:34:56,054 --> 00:35:01,140
you can make it simpler or maybe you
need to change your approach altogether

568
00:35:02,004 --> 00:35:05,053
or would images were better than tax

569
00:35:05,089 --> 00:35:08,152
there's our prayer a picture's worth
1000 words

570
00:35:09,052 --> 00:35:13,061
sometimes it's just easier to do it with
a dry like with me a fortune

571
00:35:14,042 --> 00:35:17,109
but little chart dry if my heart it's a
quick read

572
00:35:18,009 --> 00:35:21,075
you can't hop up and go on your way as
opposed to paying

573
00:35:21,075 --> 00:35:25,159
okay when you get here left your thumb
up for that Leo will hop over the lads

574
00:35:26,059 --> 00:35:29,108
would be ridiculous

575
00:35:30,008 --> 00:35:33,016
and make sure that feels like an
extension to your brand

576
00:35:33,016 --> 00:35:37,027
because onboarding it's going to be the
first experienced that somebody had to

577
00:35:37,027 --> 00:35:38,101
be there after game

578
00:35:39,001 --> 00:35:42,024
kinda like a wedding invitation our
party invitation

579
00:35:42,024 --> 00:35:45,081
affect the tone for the entire
experience

580
00:35:45,081 --> 00:35:48,094
so make sure feel exactly like your
brand

581
00:35:48,094 --> 00:35:52,127
like the personality where at

582
00:35:53,027 --> 00:35:56,091
and birth is a very important one

583
00:35:56,091 --> 00:35:59,108
always give people an option to get

584
00:36:00,008 --> 00:36:04,077
alway the father lunchtime fashion
yesterday Natalia talks about

585
00:36:04,077 --> 00:36:08,122
the dark days of the interwebs with the
big crazy flash intro

586
00:36:09,022 --> 00:36:12,065
and all people wanted with skip intro
skip intro

587
00:36:12,065 --> 00:36:16,152
and that's exactly what we're talking
about here you don't know if someone has

588
00:36:17,052 --> 00:36:20,076
use your app on another day by if they
watched

589
00:36:20,076 --> 00:36:23,170
their friend use your app her friend
paper just impatient and want to get

590
00:36:24,007 --> 00:36:25,013
going

591
00:36:26,003 --> 00:36:29,087
if people want to watch her on boarding
no matter how of a midair

592
00:36:30,014 --> 00:36:33,019
don't make them and finally

593
00:36:33,019 --> 00:36:36,058
learning should be an enjoyable
experience

594
00:36:36,058 --> 00:36:39,135
it's going to be Plaza again it's your
first impression

595
00:36:40,035 --> 00:36:44,057
up I've after the game for you want to
make sure that

596
00:36:44,057 --> 00:36:47,121
it's a good one let's take a look at
flights

597
00:36:48,021 --> 00:36:51,044
which I think they have a really great
on boarding experience

598
00:36:51,044 --> 00:36:54,061
back close button up fares are optional
gap

599
00:36:54,061 --> 00:36:57,156
you I have faith going on gestures and
so that's why they wanted to give them

600
00:36:58,056 --> 00:37:01,098
just a very brief onboarding explanation

601
00:37:01,098 --> 00:37:05,104
attacked invoke that joy travel

602
00:37:06,058 --> 00:37:13,058
just a few short screen visual design
matches every other aspect of the app

603
00:37:15,073 --> 00:37:18,078
and when you're all done tap ready to
fly

604
00:37:19,023 --> 00:37:22,026
and you get a nice little animation fun
right

605
00:37:22,026 --> 00:37:26,068
enjoyable sure InPrivate

606
00:37:26,068 --> 00:37:29,099
so make sure if you need to provide
onboarding but you're doing in a way

607
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:29,190
that fun

608
00:37:30,009 --> 00:37:34,016
nobody likes a long boring lecture

609
00:37:34,097 --> 00:37:38,106
so these are the things they need to
thrive for if you need onboarding

610
00:37:39,087 --> 00:37:42,091
if you need on morning

611
00:37:42,091 --> 00:37:46,149
now whether I have an app or game one
thing that's always a challenge is

612
00:37:47,049 --> 00:37:51,118
at how to teach people about gesture
search I risk open handsome and

613
00:37:52,018 --> 00:37:55,066
anything that doesn't have some sort of
visual representation

614
00:37:55,066 --> 00:37:58,124
in the UI so let me give you a few tips

615
00:37:59,024 --> 00:38:02,105
about how to make the invisible visible

616
00:38:03,005 --> 00:38:06,042
and the first one is using animation cue

617
00:38:06,042 --> 00:38:09,083
now I know not if you're gonna make a
big brown fear 0

618
00:38:09,083 --> 00:38:12,181
but there's a lot of things that you can
do to convey the interactivity

619
00:38:13,081 --> 00:38:16,105
or the gesture in a very elegant way

620
00:38:17,005 --> 00:38:20,061
your key people focus on the UI not on

621
00:38:20,061 --> 00:38:23,092
on the kieres and visit jet fighter

622
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:27,147
it's an app that specializes in luxury
hotels and resorts

623
00:38:28,047 --> 00:38:31,094
they've got tons of amazing photography
which is one thing

624
00:38:31,094 --> 00:38:34,193
that's not part from their competitors

625
00:38:35,093 --> 00:38:38,119
this gentle giraffe love the photo lets
you know

626
00:38:39,019 --> 00:38:43,034
at interactive but you can't touch it
and explore different aspects

627
00:38:43,034 --> 00:38:48,048
have stunning kitchen

628
00:38:48,048 --> 00:38:51,126
invites you to touch it

629
00:38:52,026 --> 00:38:56,030
now the wedding how Tracker app uses
horizontal movement to show that the

630
00:38:56,003 --> 00:38:59,015
screens are swipe the ball

631
00:38:59,042 --> 00:39:03,076
so bad and if you don't quite fit it'll
auto advance

632
00:39:03,076 --> 00:39:07,097
got a nice rewind page what type of
animation at the end for that you know

633
00:39:07,097 --> 00:39:08,101
you've had the last I am

634
00:39:09,037 --> 00:39:14,090
and then you can flip through for
anything you might have missed

635
00:39:14,009 --> 00:39:17,103
and those are just some other way for
you can use animation to really help in

636
00:39:18,084 --> 00:39:19,097
Courage people are

637
00:39:19,097 --> 00:39:22,113
plane gestures are other of factor Buri

638
00:39:23,013 --> 00:39:26,101
and again there were a lot of tips on
the stand Tuesday fashion

639
00:39:27,001 --> 00:39:30,006
so make sure to check it out if you
didn't already seen it

640
00:39:30,006 --> 00:39:34,015
see a now another factor teaching tool
is

641
00:39:34,015 --> 00:39:38,074
temporary him just really quick tips
about jesters

642
00:39:38,074 --> 00:39:42,143
the physiognomy is tight ass again as i
showed earlier there on boarding is all

643
00:39:43,043 --> 00:39:45,066
about the core concept

644
00:39:45,066 --> 00:39:49,124
so instead once you get into the UI they
don't need to tell you about that

645
00:39:50,024 --> 00:39:53,033
but have time but they give you just a
couple animation cue

646
00:39:54,014 --> 00:39:58,039
and temporary can't for tapping on
article headline

647
00:39:58,039 --> 00:40:01,123
has a horizontal animation and then that
short message about

648
00:40:02,023 --> 00:40:06,032
swiping so if the horrifying animation

649
00:40:07,013 --> 00:40:11,016
didn't do it for you this method which
only appears for two seconds

650
00:40:11,016 --> 00:40:15,025
makes it abundantly clear you can swipe
from article article

651
00:40:15,025 --> 00:40:18,040
and you'll note if they didn't force you
to swipe

652
00:40:18,004 --> 00:40:21,040
because I might be interested in reading
this article I just wanna make sure you

653
00:40:21,076 --> 00:40:25,115
know how to navigate

654
00:40:26,015 --> 00:40:30,112
lightly has a different approach the
photo editing application

655
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:35,100
and the first time you use it they give
you hints about gestures with short tips

656
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,084
so here are just selected argyll filter
and so what comes up as a message about

657
00:40:40,084 --> 00:40:40,171
adjusting

658
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:45,080
the Attensity now I just want to point
out they don't

659
00:40:45,008 --> 00:40:48,069
actually force you to adjust the
intensity

660
00:40:49,041 --> 00:40:52,087
any other player anyplace the tap with
the Smith at hand

661
00:40:52,087 --> 00:40:56,174
whether it's adjusting the 10-city
picking another filter from the bottom

662
00:40:57,074 --> 00:41:01,125
or using any the other control

663
00:41:02,025 --> 00:41:05,026
for an addition to the plane temporary
head

664
00:41:05,035 --> 00:41:10,094
you can also think about providing
controls for people to turn them on

665
00:41:10,094 --> 00:41:13,123
and this is what we do in garage fan on
I laugh

666
00:41:14,023 --> 00:41:18,065
now this is something that's more
appropriate for deeper application

667
00:41:18,065 --> 00:41:23,097
not every at warrants bath and you can
come and just start playing the drums

668
00:41:23,097 --> 00:41:23,182
and going not

669
00:41:24,082 --> 00:41:27,171
without any assistance at all but if you
want to know more

670
00:41:28,071 --> 00:41:32,108
get a deeper knowledge about drumming
because it's sort of a specialty

671
00:41:33,008 --> 00:41:36,021
K-fifty want to become a better musician

672
00:41:36,021 --> 00:41:39,118
and you think that question mark button
up in the up in the corner

673
00:41:40,018 --> 00:41:44,033
turned bomb even on modal kept

674
00:41:44,033 --> 00:41:47,035
see you can keep playing the drums

675
00:41:47,053 --> 00:41:50,152
while you're reading more about them and
without those non-motor

676
00:41:51,052 --> 00:41:54,126
without these tipsy might not realize
that you can get different found out the

677
00:41:55,026 --> 00:41:56,040
hi-hat

678
00:41:56,004 --> 00:41:59,005
a fun word is that you're tapping at

679
00:41:59,005 --> 00:42:03,102
or that a single tap will play the crash
cymbal and the bass drum together

680
00:42:04,047 --> 00:42:09,085
but a two finger tap is what results in
just the crash cymbal

681
00:42:09,085 --> 00:42:11,173
or you would know that the fear the
drummer Pete is determined by the

682
00:42:12,073 --> 00:42:13,171
distance between your two finger

683
00:42:14,071 --> 00:42:19,090
all really useful so if you think you
have an audience that wants a deeper

684
00:42:19,009 --> 00:42:19,085
knowledge

685
00:42:20,066 --> 00:42:23,121
or needs actor Guy 10:05 specialized
subject

686
00:42:24,021 --> 00:42:27,055
this could be a good method and

687
00:42:27,055 --> 00:42:31,061
and it's really important but you can
continue to use the app for that you can

688
00:42:31,061 --> 00:42:33,064
learn by doing

689
00:42:33,091 --> 00:42:38,092
you can put it into practice right on
the spot

690
00:42:38,092 --> 00:42:42,144
because all of these approaches work
passive they're shown in contact

691
00:42:43,044 --> 00:42:46,098
it's important that when you're
demonstrating gestures you wanna do it

692
00:42:46,098 --> 00:42:49,105
right now moment when people can
experiment with them

693
00:42:50,005 --> 00:42:54,037
so that they're learning by doing so now
I would like to address

694
00:42:54,037 --> 00:42:58,041
a dirty word an IRFU I define

695
00:42:58,077 --> 00:43:01,091
help help

696
00:43:01,091 --> 00:43:05,138
nobody nobody wants to think they need
help or nobody wants to ask for help

697
00:43:06,038 --> 00:43:09,040
and as a designer I certainly hope bad

698
00:43:09,058 --> 00:43:12,151
every abstract have my you live
intuitive to use

699
00:43:13,051 --> 00:43:19,053
to every person in every scenario no
matter what their names

700
00:43:19,071 --> 00:43:22,156
sometimes mister hard to achieve

701
00:43:23,056 --> 00:43:27,075
I mean people have different experiences
different backgrounds

702
00:43:27,075 --> 00:43:31,075
they come from different culture they
may have a lot of experience with Apple

703
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:32,100
platform

704
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,034
but not without I'll ask for specialty
nah lives

705
00:43:36,034 --> 00:43:40,075
like I can navigate around just about
any after on the Apple platform

706
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:43,112
but I'm not a good photographer so
although filter

707
00:43:44,012 --> 00:43:47,020
on Photofact I don't know what to do
with them

708
00:43:47,002 --> 00:43:49,011
I don't know what I should do you find
how they're gonna make my pictures

709
00:43:50,001 --> 00:43:51,087
better

710
00:43:51,096 --> 00:43:54,119
and not for how can be very handy

711
00:43:55,019 --> 00:44:00,101
but it's not for us to feel like a
lecture from a mean teacher

712
00:44:01,001 --> 00:44:04,053
or boring nobody wants for

713
00:44:04,053 --> 00:44:07,062
we're moving away from that large
reference manual right

714
00:44:08,043 --> 00:44:13,105
at a few more like that just making
things a little bit easier on people

715
00:44:14,005 --> 00:44:17,101
or maybe like support from a friend or
family member just giving you a couple

716
00:44:18,001 --> 00:44:19,045
tips

717
00:44:19,045 --> 00:44:22,063
because I'm definitely not suggesting
that you had a huge reference

718
00:44:22,063 --> 00:44:27,087
documents Tirath there are a lot of ways
but you can provide help

719
00:44:27,087 --> 00:44:31,155
without people even realizing that they
got any

720
00:44:32,055 --> 00:44:36,056
what are the easier things that you can
do is to put instructions in your empty

721
00:44:36,056 --> 00:44:37,113
containers

722
00:44:38,013 --> 00:44:41,105
rather than just saying no results for
third store

723
00:44:42,005 --> 00:44:46,080
at an iffy here you wanna keep in Mt
view from being at that

724
00:44:46,008 --> 00:44:51,014
if at all possible let people know what
to expect here or how to get out of this

725
00:44:51,086 --> 00:44:54,122
dead-end situation

726
00:44:55,022 --> 00:44:58,039
so an ivory for I left there's a theater
view

727
00:44:58,039 --> 00:45:02,045
were you complete a project go through
you can view them

728
00:45:02,045 --> 00:45:05,113
now before you create any project
there's nothing to show here

729
00:45:06,013 --> 00:45:09,017
so the message lets you know exactly
what you're going to find here in the

730
00:45:09,053 --> 00:45:10,060
future

731
00:45:11,023 --> 00:45:14,100
and then they tell you how to get
started making a product project

732
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,042
for that you can have a movie here
really quick way and it's worth pointing

733
00:45:18,042 --> 00:45:19,125
out that both the math fares

734
00:45:20,025 --> 00:45:23,062
and the icon in the navigation our
interactive

735
00:45:23,062 --> 00:45:27,145
seeking get going quickly while you're
learning the UI

736
00:45:28,045 --> 00:45:31,047
and the same approach can work for empty
input field

737
00:45:31,047 --> 00:45:35,095
to you playful or text can be super
informant at

738
00:45:35,095 --> 00:45:39,131
the third up to you which is at counter
app

739
00:45:40,031 --> 00:45:43,102
you can of course manager on a point man
for one of the things that's cool about

740
00:45:44,002 --> 00:45:48,018
up to you is that you can also subscribe
to other people counter

741
00:45:48,018 --> 00:45:52,117
and the other people can be your friends
or can be Barack Obama

742
00:45:53,017 --> 00:45:56,025
may have time for counters available on
here so you can browse to find the ones

743
00:45:56,097 --> 00:45:56,188
you want

744
00:45:57,088 --> 00:46:00,117
you can offer starts and that first text

745
00:46:01,017 --> 00:46:05,021
is very suggested in terms of the types
of things that you might want to put in

746
00:46:05,057 --> 00:46:06,062
there

747
00:46:06,062 --> 00:46:09,109
now I got the impression from the
graphic that I could search for sports

748
00:46:10,009 --> 00:46:11,058
teams but

749
00:46:11,058 --> 00:46:14,104
I didn't realize I can just type in San
Francisco I'm see

750
00:46:15,004 --> 00:46:18,019
all the listings for San Francisco

751
00:46:18,019 --> 00:46:21,056
it's very helpful

752
00:46:21,056 --> 00:46:25,098
and it didn't feel like hell right I
didn't even realize I needed any help

753
00:46:25,098 --> 00:46:29,114
but yeah I've learned something now

754
00:46:30,014 --> 00:46:33,019
you can also think about showing
supporting information

755
00:46:33,019 --> 00:46:36,106
right and mine and we do this with
batting

756
00:46:37,006 --> 00:46:40,022
now not of adding because they don't on
the year

757
00:46:40,022 --> 00:46:45,024
game time is a pretty universal comp
that there's nothing else to say here

758
00:46:45,042 --> 00:46:50,089
butt dial a fifth well some people might
have some questions about what baghdad

759
00:46:50,089 --> 00:46:54,164
so there's just a little bit more
information right in that moment

760
00:46:55,064 --> 00:46:58,163
again it didn't feel like hell

761
00:46:59,063 --> 00:47:04,065
and with games we are fortune that chalk
drawing is giving you that little hints

762
00:47:04,065 --> 00:47:09,071
and they don't just do this and the
tutorial level it's throughout the game

763
00:47:10,025 --> 00:47:14,030
in fact showing information in mind
often a great alternative to onboarding

764
00:47:14,075 --> 00:47:15,140
altogether

765
00:47:16,004 --> 00:47:19,031
you don't have to tell everything up
front just put the axe from

766
00:47:19,067 --> 00:47:26,067
information in line so it's fair right
in that moment that people need it

767
00:47:27,017 --> 00:47:30,023
now another great approaches to watch
for indications that people are

768
00:47:30,077 --> 00:47:35,116
stack now when it comes to games though
you have to be wary about over helping

769
00:47:36,016 --> 00:47:36,080
people

770
00:47:36,008 --> 00:47:40,013
because it's a game nobody enjoys having
the puzzle fault for them

771
00:47:41,003 --> 00:47:44,059
that's not fun gonna give people a
chance to play all

772
00:47:44,086 --> 00:47:48,099
all on their own and then watch for
clues they might be stack

773
00:47:48,099 --> 00:47:51,180
and that's when you offer how

774
00:47:52,008 --> 00:47:56,047
with Rio 4chan if you try and number of
times to get over this very basic

775
00:47:57,019 --> 00:47:59,103
obstacle on you don't make it

776
00:48:00,003 --> 00:48:03,024
they give you the option on screen
control

777
00:48:03,024 --> 00:48:09,045
again they only do this if it looks like
you're struggling with that first job

778
00:48:09,045 --> 00:48:13,083
the room to offer have a great approach
now if you haven't played it at the

779
00:48:13,083 --> 00:48:17,158
mystery poverty have our game your
second through many follow crew after

780
00:48:18,058 --> 00:48:20,130
clear after crew to make your escape

781
00:48:21,003 --> 00:48:25,015
now if you've been struggling for a long
time we still have managed to accomplish

782
00:48:25,042 --> 00:48:27,044
the next thing

783
00:48:27,044 --> 00:48:30,075
a give you this question mark back

784
00:48:30,075 --> 00:48:33,123
and this is great because it's giving
you the option

785
00:48:34,023 --> 00:48:37,047
upper hand because it's true I might be

786
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:41,079
stock or I may have been distracted

787
00:48:41,079 --> 00:48:44,120
my dog might have started barking or
someone needed something and walked into

788
00:48:45,002 --> 00:48:46,021
the room

789
00:48:46,039 --> 00:48:51,083
so that's really good cuz they're not
they're not solving the puzzle forming

790
00:48:51,083 --> 00:48:55,169
however if I am Relief Act and I'm at
the point walking away it's an uptick

791
00:48:56,069 --> 00:48:59,075
keeping gays to keep me moving for

792
00:49:00,029 --> 00:49:03,081
and fed up giving way the answer biggie
clears

793
00:49:03,081 --> 00:49:06,084
CR to feel guilty doesn't have to be
like cheating

794
00:49:07,011 --> 00:49:10,086
you have to feel bad about it right and
it doesn't devalue year

795
00:49:10,086 --> 00:49:15,088
peachy man for people who can use the
cliff we're all gonna get something and

796
00:49:15,088 --> 00:49:18,186
some of us are gonna get there faster
but this works out really well everyone

797
00:49:19,086 --> 00:49:20,107
can feel really good

798
00:49:21,007 --> 00:49:25,055
when they finished the game and the sky
hands can be helpful

799
00:49:25,055 --> 00:49:28,079
with ap to you the first guy guy

800
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:31,162
another 1i have this year's Apple Design
Award winner

801
00:49:32,062 --> 00:49:35,131
you can pan all around the sky and see
the consolation

802
00:49:36,031 --> 00:49:39,090
planet comment all sorts of star

803
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:42,038
and they were Honda information

804
00:49:43,019 --> 00:49:46,057
about almost anything in the night sky

805
00:49:46,057 --> 00:49:49,066
now you might think that tapping on a
star the way to get that information

806
00:49:50,047 --> 00:49:54,059
but I would make it a little too easy to
navigate into the details here

807
00:49:54,059 --> 00:49:57,152
you be going on accident you getting
frustrated

808
00:49:58,052 --> 00:50:02,097
so instead the right way to get to get
to that information

809
00:50:02,097 --> 00:50:05,181
is by flooding a star and then tapping
that I button on the right side of the

810
00:50:06,081 --> 00:50:09,083
screen

811
00:50:10,001 --> 00:50:13,048
and if you tap its are gone to try and
select it

812
00:50:13,048 --> 00:50:17,053
or get more information you get a
pulsing animation and that glow

813
00:50:17,098 --> 00:50:23,126
called attention to itself they're using
animation to attract your attention

814
00:50:24,026 --> 00:50:28,029
and it's really elegant because if you
double tap it start thinking

815
00:50:28,029 --> 00:50:31,087
are maybe I can tap hard enough for
maybe I need tapped wife

816
00:50:31,087 --> 00:50:36,142
a powerful every time you tack to get
your attention

817
00:50:37,042 --> 00:50:40,091
so they're keeping an eye out for you
that your stock and trying to pull you

818
00:50:40,091 --> 00:50:41,126
in the right direction

819
00:50:42,026 --> 00:50:45,045
get you back on track

820
00:50:45,045 --> 00:50:49,052
and all the steps that I found you are
really just about anticipating people's

821
00:50:49,052 --> 00:50:50,080
needs

822
00:50:50,008 --> 00:50:54,095
telling people what they need to know
and the moment that they need to know it

823
00:50:55,067 --> 00:50:59,110
think about but the restaurant again and
I talked about earlier

824
00:51:00,001 --> 00:51:03,058
you wanna see the dessert menu before
you've been seeded or while you're

825
00:51:03,067 --> 00:51:04,112
eating your appetizer

826
00:51:05,012 --> 00:51:08,073
you want when you finished your mail

827
00:51:08,073 --> 00:51:11,124
and when you have good service at a
restaurant means the wait staff is there

828
00:51:12,024 --> 00:51:13,041
when you need them

829
00:51:13,041 --> 00:51:17,073
and they're not there when you doubt and
that's exactly the pro

830
00:51:17,073 --> 00:51:21,138
approach you wanna take if you got help
and fire your application

831
00:51:22,038 --> 00:51:26,061
and figure is really one of the best
examples but I've seen out there

832
00:51:26,061 --> 00:51:30,070
it's an anonymous social networking app
so what this means is that you see poets

833
00:51:30,007 --> 00:51:34,020
from your friends but you don't know who
they are because everything's anonymous

834
00:51:34,083 --> 00:51:38,083
at the rowing interesting way to
interact with people

835
00:51:38,083 --> 00:51:42,125
now the first time your feet won't their
explaining in the moment exactly the

836
00:51:43,025 --> 00:51:44,044
information they need

837
00:51:44,044 --> 00:51:48,048
now so here I'm scrolling through my
feed and

838
00:51:48,084 --> 00:51:51,112
I don't know anyone in the UK now

839
00:51:52,012 --> 00:51:55,040
traveled across creme seeking a friend

840
00:51:55,004 --> 00:51:58,013
where are my friends now

841
00:51:58,049 --> 00:52:02,061
I don't have my phone number yet shoot

842
00:52:02,061 --> 00:52:06,064
and what for star me and I wonder %ah
popular one

843
00:52:06,091 --> 00:52:09,109
when you go to comment

844
00:52:10,009 --> 00:52:13,055
they explain why they are all these
icons here they're just letting you know

845
00:52:13,055 --> 00:52:14,097
about commenting

846
00:52:14,097 --> 00:52:18,115
because that's where you are in apt
they're not telling you about navigation

847
00:52:19,015 --> 00:52:23,093
or what is the star me and things like
that their focus on commenting

848
00:52:23,093 --> 00:52:26,115
it's worth noting that they're just
giving one piece of information I retire

849
00:52:27,015 --> 00:52:29,076
after all

850
00:52:29,076 --> 00:52:32,175
and if you're the first to comment
they've populated their empty

851
00:52:33,075 --> 00:52:37,126
the Mt view with information you know
the common for gonna be there

852
00:52:38,026 --> 00:52:41,061
for general-purpose to be the first one

853
00:52:41,061 --> 00:52:45,139
and I just love that the placeholder tax
encourages you to say something

854
00:52:46,039 --> 00:52:49,088
hines great

855
00:52:49,088 --> 00:52:53,115
think about what people need to know
based on where they are here after game

856
00:52:54,015 --> 00:52:57,078
how long they've been using it and
anticipating people for me

857
00:52:57,078 --> 00:53:00,107
it's just another way that you're going
to be able to provide help without it

858
00:53:01,007 --> 00:53:01,084
feeling

859
00:53:01,084 --> 00:53:04,117
like hell

860
00:53:05,017 --> 00:53:08,108
and be sure to take the opportunity to
inspire people

861
00:53:09,008 --> 00:53:13,074
like secret that we face some think I

862
00:53:13,074 --> 00:53:17,153
now a lot of people use very defect
reminder Pentax search exports course

863
00:53:18,053 --> 00:53:19,059
things like that

864
00:53:20,013 --> 00:53:24,092
I remember when you found out that
theory would answer questions like this

865
00:53:24,092 --> 00:53:27,175
mean all the fun this convenience
features the source of entertainment as

866
00:53:28,075 --> 00:53:29,136
well

867
00:53:30,036 --> 00:53:35,036
unexpected and fun and now theories more
valuable to me

868
00:53:35,036 --> 00:53:38,075
because she's not just the utility
anymore she comedy

869
00:53:38,075 --> 00:53:41,159
she's flattery it's great

870
00:53:42,059 --> 00:53:45,132
people might come cheer up with a
certain expectation

871
00:53:46,032 --> 00:53:50,051
about getting one thing done but when
they discover that your app can do more

872
00:53:50,051 --> 00:53:50,140
for them

873
00:53:51,004 --> 00:53:54,076
well then the app becomes even more
valuable

874
00:53:55,012 --> 00:53:59,075
it's gonna feel like a bonus prize

875
00:53:59,075 --> 00:54:02,123
and that's why we fear we give you a lot
of suggestions of things that you can

876
00:54:03,023 --> 00:54:03,102
ask her

877
00:54:04,002 --> 00:54:07,094
you just tap that question mark button
you're gonna get along left

878
00:54:07,094 --> 00:54:12,094
afsane recast phiri and you may have
known that you can use very 10 ish a

879
00:54:12,094 --> 00:54:14,097
call for

880
00:54:14,097 --> 00:54:17,148
have her make an appointment on your
calendar but did you know that she also

881
00:54:18,048 --> 00:54:20,077
will book restaurant for you

882
00:54:20,077 --> 00:54:23,085
or Italian movie times I mean if work
goes on and on

883
00:54:24,057 --> 00:54:29,074
on path does it with some other
onboarding

884
00:54:29,074 --> 00:54:33,095
and their private social network so they
really need you to register because

885
00:54:33,095 --> 00:54:36,139
everything is orange around your
personal information

886
00:54:37,039 --> 00:54:40,081
but before registering they're giving
your theory screen

887
00:54:40,081 --> 00:54:44,147
that covers both the features that the
apt but also

888
00:54:45,047 --> 00:54:49,111
how you might want to use them a lot of
people go to pass thinking they're going

889
00:54:50,011 --> 00:54:53,013
to use it for work but now they're gonna
be thinking about

890
00:54:53,013 --> 00:54:57,078
how they can use them in their personal
life to you

891
00:54:57,078 --> 00:55:01,079
or with Pinterest got Mr probz

892
00:55:01,079 --> 00:55:04,145
I mean maybe you can depend for after
they were interested in nail art or

893
00:55:05,045 --> 00:55:08,124
wanting referee for dinner party but now
you're off thinking about

894
00:55:09,024 --> 00:55:12,027
gardening and many think about what else

895
00:55:12,054 --> 00:55:15,113
interest can be used for

896
00:55:16,013 --> 00:55:19,056
first step away from that traditional
idea of how

897
00:55:19,056 --> 00:55:24,153
reference manual and think about how you
can anticipate people ask me

898
00:55:25,053 --> 00:55:30,068
putting instructions an empty containers
n sewing Supporting Information Line

899
00:55:30,068 --> 00:55:33,097
it's about telling people what they need
snow in that moment

900
00:55:33,097 --> 00:55:36,109
but they need to know it like the
perfect for

901
00:55:37,009 --> 00:55:40,087
at a restaurant there when you need them
an invisible

902
00:55:40,087 --> 00:55:45,119
when you down when you're doing all that
don't forget to take the opportunity to

903
00:55:46,019 --> 00:55:47,073
inspire people

904
00:55:47,073 --> 00:55:50,121
that increased now I've increase you
tell me about your app

905
00:55:51,021 --> 00:55:54,064
it's getting increased I am

906
00:55:54,064 --> 00:55:58,156
fellow if you only take a few things
away from the talk today

907
00:55:59,056 --> 00:56:02,110
in summary ollie

908
00:56:03,001 --> 00:56:07,072
require people to register when it's
absolutely necessary

909
00:56:07,081 --> 00:56:10,118
after South if you really need
onboarding at all

910
00:56:11,018 --> 00:56:14,034
if they don't need any information
before getting started and Jeff but I'm

911
00:56:14,034 --> 00:56:14,120
