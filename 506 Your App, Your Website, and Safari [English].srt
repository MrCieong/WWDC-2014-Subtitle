1
00:00:13,084 --> 00:00:14,136
well confession 506

2
00:00:15,036 --> 00:00:18,059
your app your website and Safari

3
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:22,068
my name's working mondello and I'm an
engineer on a safari and WebKit team

4
00:00:22,068 --> 00:00:25,154
some four get started gonna ask one
obvious question

5
00:00:26,054 --> 00:00:29,453
show of hands and then a second question
the first of

6
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:34,050
how many do you have caps in the App
Store nearly all of you

7
00:00:34,005 --> 00:00:38,069
great book in a WBC you're in the right
place I'm how many of those APs

8
00:00:38,069 --> 00:00:42,077
have an associated web site now the show
of hands that's

9
00:00:42,077 --> 00:00:45,126
excellent you are all in the right place
awesome

10
00:00:46,026 --> 00:00:49,555
so yesterday you saw Craig demo

11
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:54,500
a bunch of cool new features with the
name continuity the ability to

12
00:00:54,005 --> 00:00:57,024
pick up writing an email where you left
off from one device to another

13
00:00:57,069 --> 00:01:01,080
picking up a phone call from one device
to another I've been thinking about

14
00:01:01,008 --> 00:01:01,837
continuity

15
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:06,950
continuity is more than just a suite of
features that we've included in the last

16
00:01:06,095 --> 00:01:06,181
ten your sanity

17
00:01:07,081 --> 00:01:10,097
and I'll SAT just regular old bird

18
00:01:10,097 --> 00:01:14,181
looked it up in the dictionary it's the
unbroken and consistent experience

19
00:01:15,081 --> 00:01:18,085
or operation have something over a
period of time

20
00:01:19,021 --> 00:01:24,052
I take comfort in this definition
because unbroken this

21
00:01:24,052 --> 00:01:28,100
and consistency are exactly what all of
us as users are looking for today

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,003
many of us on more than one device

23
00:01:32,003 --> 00:01:36,070
we move between those devices throughout
our day something that's not uncommon s

24
00:01:36,007 --> 00:01:40,136
starting a task with an app on your
iPhone and finishing up later on the

25
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:42,170
haps website on your Mac

26
00:01:42,017 --> 00:01:46,079
for instance and this year we've got a
call technologies that you can

27
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,478
participate in continuity

28
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:53,090
hand-off at exactly what Craig use to
move from sending email on one device

29
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:57,096
to typing up on the other we're gonna
fall session on hand of this year

30
00:01:57,096 --> 00:02:01,185
it's tomorrow at 2 p.m. so if you're
here you're gonna be interested in that

31
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:02,110
as well

32
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:07,210
but even before hand of users are making

33
00:02:07,021 --> 00:02:11,030
these kinds of transitions between taps
web sites

34
00:02:11,003 --> 00:02:15,008
and various devices every single day and
in this session

35
00:02:15,008 --> 00:02:18,049
I'm gonna go over some of the best
opportunities that we've identified

36
00:02:19,021 --> 00:02:22,190
to make these kinds of transition
smoother for our users

37
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:26,540
ensuring continuity for all of our users
is going to require

38
00:02:26,054 --> 00:02:29,393
a holistic approach to software
development bringing together

39
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:34,550
three different kinds of disciplines the
first discipline

40
00:02:34,055 --> 00:02:37,129
is that the app developer whoever's
writing Coco Cocoa Touch

41
00:02:38,029 --> 00:02:42,061
objective-c and now swept probably must
have you in this audience

42
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:45,139
but it's also to take the back end
website administrator

43
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:51,123
off again take the back end website
administrator

44
00:02:52,023 --> 00:02:55,532
whoever's running user accounts state
databases

45
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:58,980
all that sort of stuff but finally

46
00:02:58,098 --> 00:03:01,153
its also gonna take the front end web
developer

47
00:03:02,053 --> 00:03:06,131
whoever's writing JavaScript HTML CSS or
whatever cornu fancy languages

48
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:08,117
preprocessing down to those these days

49
00:03:09,017 --> 00:03:13,098
so if you're here you probably
specialize in one of these areas

50
00:03:13,098 --> 00:03:16,497
you may know about to have them you
might just be getting started

51
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:21,140
work to work in a one-person shop you
may be responsible for all three of

52
00:03:21,014 --> 00:03:23,143
these aspects if your application or
service

53
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:26,780
regardless no matter which bucket you
fall into

54
00:03:26,078 --> 00:03:29,397
you're gonna leave this session today
with actionable techniques you can put

55
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:30,155
into place

56
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:35,230
to make your users experience is better
specifically

57
00:03:35,023 --> 00:03:39,065
we're gonna go into today is giving your
native Iowa sap

58
00:03:39,065 --> 00:03:42,137
access to credentials that Safari has
stored

59
00:03:43,037 --> 00:03:46,356
for your website to make your users
login experiences

60
00:03:46,689 --> 00:03:51,620
easier than ever then gonna learn about
autofill how that works on the web

61
00:03:51,062 --> 00:03:56,120
and ways to make that better as well
democrat a look at ways that Safari

62
00:03:57,002 --> 00:03:58,007
promotes your website

63
00:03:58,007 --> 00:04:01,012
and your website's content learn how to
make that

64
00:04:02,002 --> 00:04:05,047
even better and finally we're gonna look
at your website

65
00:04:05,065 --> 00:04:08,124
and how we can make your website
consistent across devices

66
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:14,370
whether the user is viewing on iphone or
on a Mac with a 27 inch Cinema Display

67
00:04:14,037 --> 00:04:18,076
that sounds good to you let's get
started

68
00:04:18,076 --> 00:04:21,130
first thing i wanna talk about his
credentials

69
00:04:22,003 --> 00:04:25,006
if you're after service has accounts
your

70
00:04:25,033 --> 00:04:28,034
defining a credentials these days for
users to prove to be

71
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:31,035
are who they say they are today

72
00:04:31,035 --> 00:04:35,068
most credentials and former user names
passports

73
00:04:35,068 --> 00:04:38,075
as matter fact my colleague injuries
been working on a corner application on

74
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:39,133
the side

75
00:04:40,033 --> 00:04:43,077
it's called shiny and its application
has accounts

76
00:04:43,077 --> 00:04:46,163
what it does is every single day that
you log into shiny

77
00:04:47,063 --> 00:04:50,070
its gonna show you a picture a shiny
object

78
00:04:50,007 --> 00:04:53,019
but only if you're logged in it's very
important to him don't understand it but

79
00:04:53,082 --> 00:04:56,105
it's going okay

80
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:00,048
something that I realized why was beta
testing injuries ap

81
00:05:00,048 --> 00:05:04,141
is that my first run experience with ap
wasn't as good as I wanted it to be

82
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:09,093
I started my relationship with shiny by
creating an account on the shiny website

83
00:05:09,093 --> 00:05:13,094
and then later I went to the app for the
first time and I got this login screen

84
00:05:13,094 --> 00:05:16,113
I could do anything until I got past the
login screen

85
00:05:17,013 --> 00:05:21,081
when I'm run into a situation like this
I might go ahead and look up my password

86
00:05:21,081 --> 00:05:25,134
in settings on I laugh or if I'm feeling
a little lazy at the moment

87
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:30,038
I just might switch back to using the
Website or leave ap altogether

88
00:05:30,074 --> 00:05:33,148
we don't want people to leave your app's
we want gauged happy users

89
00:05:34,048 --> 00:05:37,125
said today I'm very happy to say that
we're gonna solve this problem

90
00:05:38,025 --> 00:05:41,030
by giving your application access to
some of the data

91
00:05:41,003 --> 00:05:45,014
the Safari have stored for your website
the usernames and passwords are saved

92
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:49,050
for your website safaris technology for
saving user names and passwords

93
00:05:49,005 --> 00:05:53,082
is called autofill and i'd give you a
little background on that right now

94
00:05:54,027 --> 00:05:57,083
first thing that article does Isabel's
are forms for you

95
00:05:57,083 --> 00:06:00,104
kinda like the forms that you see when
checking out an online shopping site

96
00:06:01,004 --> 00:06:04,009
with information from your Contact Card

97
00:06:04,054 --> 00:06:07,121
of a also saves and fills user names and
passwords

98
00:06:08,021 --> 00:06:11,117
to make locking in your website's a
brief

99
00:06:12,017 --> 00:06:16,028
and finally autofill generates passwords
for users

100
00:06:16,028 --> 00:06:19,089
given the state of web site security
these days with major Web sites being

101
00:06:19,089 --> 00:06:20,161
compromised with seems like

102
00:06:21,061 --> 00:06:24,136
every other week it's a really good idea
to use a random password that doesn't

103
00:06:25,036 --> 00:06:26,112
overlap with password to using

104
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:31,020
on other web sites and finally

105
00:06:31,002 --> 00:06:35,008
I cloud keychain of else thinks your
passwords across all of your devices

106
00:06:35,008 --> 00:06:39,091
said it a breeze to login no matter
which device you're on

107
00:06:40,063 --> 00:06:43,115
I really love it when my credentials
thinking across my devices

108
00:06:44,015 --> 00:06:47,062
when those credentials a randomly
generated I am in a sweet spot

109
00:06:47,062 --> 00:06:51,079
both security and convenience but I've
already mentioned

110
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:54,128
one place that the system breaks down

111
00:06:55,028 --> 00:06:58,096
and that's when your application enters
the picture when the user hits an app's

112
00:06:58,096 --> 00:06:59,134
login screen

113
00:07:00,034 --> 00:07:03,053
anything can happen they might look up
the password

114
00:07:03,053 --> 00:07:06,101
they might already know it they might
decide to leave your apt

115
00:07:07,001 --> 00:07:10,032
so we want to do today is taking this
failure point

116
00:07:10,032 --> 00:07:13,104
and turn it into something awesome
letting your applications leverage the

117
00:07:14,004 --> 00:07:14,080
security

118
00:07:14,008 --> 00:07:18,105
and convenience i cud keychain and
Safari autofill

119
00:07:19,077 --> 00:07:22,169
for users it's going in going from
seeing application login screen

120
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:26,133
the looks like this to seeing a simple
picker

121
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:31,060
where they can securely and easily hand
credentials back to your application

122
00:07:31,006 --> 00:07:35,078
that you could use to attempt the login
no typing acquired

123
00:07:36,032 --> 00:07:39,039
to get into the details how this works
I'm excited

124
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:46,039
invite my colleagues enter Bali to the
stage Andrew

125
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:50,020
be thank you rikki

126
00:07:50,092 --> 00:07:53,165
guess I'm Andrew Morley from coral West
security engineering

127
00:07:54,065 --> 00:07:57,158
and maybe predictably for security
engineer I'm going to start off by

128
00:07:58,058 --> 00:08:00,156
talking about password security

129
00:08:01,056 --> 00:08:04,112
passwords some of the most sensitive and
important data

130
00:08:05,012 --> 00:08:09,017
do we have on any of our devices
passwords to banking website

131
00:08:09,017 --> 00:08:12,041
have access to all our money and
passwords to

132
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:15,074
even something like social media well
thats really our entire

133
00:08:15,074 --> 00:08:18,111
online reputation so we've really gotta

134
00:08:19,011 --> 00:08:22,059
protect them as we

135
00:08:22,059 --> 00:08:27,088
visit website in Safari and let Safari
stayed user names and passwords for us

136
00:08:27,088 --> 00:08:30,161
it's keeping track love which web sites
they came from to make sure

137
00:08:31,061 --> 00:08:35,360
they are only ever filled back to the
exact same website

138
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:39,640
this security and actually privacy as
well guarantee

139
00:08:39,064 --> 00:08:42,333
is provided by Safari itself since

140
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:46,660
it has all the necessary information
about which credentials

141
00:08:46,066 --> 00:08:49,148
went with which website and I'm using
credentials here

142
00:08:50,048 --> 00:08:54,081
to mean a username and password pair

143
00:08:54,081 --> 00:08:57,085
I'm sure like me you have hundreds of

144
00:08:58,021 --> 00:09:01,092
native I less applications installed

145
00:09:01,092 --> 00:09:04,185
and these are all run and managed by
Iowa

146
00:09:05,085 --> 00:09:08,122
so what we need to do is provided way to
let

147
00:09:09,022 --> 00:09:12,106
I A with no that a particular ap is
associated

148
00:09:13,006 --> 00:09:16,022
with a particular website and to do so

149
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:19,094
in a secure way so

150
00:09:19,094 --> 00:09:22,133
I'm going to be talking about a way to
associate ap

151
00:09:23,033 --> 00:09:26,064
and your website and its really quite
easy

152
00:09:26,064 --> 00:09:29,108
it involves adding one file your website

153
00:09:30,008 --> 00:09:34,013
and one new entitlement to your ap

154
00:09:34,013 --> 00:09:38,038
once you've done that then you get
access to a few simple API is

155
00:09:38,038 --> 00:09:42,100
which allows you to see if you use a
have anything saved in Safari

156
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,062
and it's so get the username and
password

157
00:09:46,062 --> 00:09:50,089
and to let Safari no if the user has
created an account

158
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:56,124
or change the password with in your
application

159
00:09:57,024 --> 00:10:00,062
so really what we doing is trying to
make sure your

160
00:10:00,062 --> 00:10:03,091
that the website developer and

161
00:10:03,091 --> 00:10:06,148
the owner of the website a really okay
with

162
00:10:07,048 --> 00:10:10,092
that two entities sharing information

163
00:10:10,092 --> 00:10:13,097
Buckley we can use crypto graffiti for
the subject much favorite favorite

164
00:10:14,042 --> 00:10:15,085
subject

165
00:10:15,085 --> 00:10:18,087
every I'll with developer has a key

166
00:10:18,087 --> 00:10:21,093
and a certificate issued through the
developer portal

167
00:10:21,093 --> 00:10:25,131
or now automatically by Xcode every
website has all

168
00:10:26,031 --> 00:10:29,083
really should have a key and certificate

169
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:32,110
issued by CA which they use to secure

170
00:10:33,001 --> 00:10:36,099
HTTPS TLS website

171
00:10:37,008 --> 00:10:42,086
first we going to look at the app side
things

172
00:10:42,086 --> 00:10:46,102
so in the same way that Safari is
maintaining internally

173
00:10:47,002 --> 00:10:51,015
a mapping between a credential and which
website it came from

174
00:10:51,015 --> 00:10:54,016
you could imagine I left having a
similar table

175
00:10:54,016 --> 00:10:57,080
linking aP's and web sites and whether
they've been approved

176
00:10:57,008 --> 00:11:00,059
to share information between them you
can see here

177
00:11:01,031 --> 00:11:04,100
that to have been marked as approved and
one is pending

178
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,043
so let's look and see what it takes to
go from from pending

179
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:12,047
to approved whenever you have it
installed

180
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:16,135
it gives iowa's a little all the domains
it which is to share with

181
00:11:17,035 --> 00:11:20,042
I with then a pens Apple ap

182
00:11:20,042 --> 00:11:23,089
site Association to the end to former
URL

183
00:11:23,089 --> 00:11:26,135
and requested from server

184
00:11:27,035 --> 00:11:30,058
the server then responds with the signed
file

185
00:11:30,058 --> 00:11:33,120
listing all the applications but it want
to share with

186
00:11:34,002 --> 00:11:37,040
I West End verifies that signature and
check

187
00:11:37,058 --> 00:11:40,063
the two ap names match

188
00:11:40,063 --> 00:11:43,063
once that occurred we know the apt name

189
00:11:43,063 --> 00:11:46,074
and the website name and we can go

190
00:11:46,074 --> 00:11:50,082
complete our table a market is approved

191
00:11:51,054 --> 00:11:54,147
such the flow let's go into a little
more detail

192
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,099
I mention that aP's include allister
remains

193
00:11:58,099 --> 00:12:01,111
there included in the apt entitlements

194
00:12:02,011 --> 00:12:05,059
an entitlement is a find

195
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:09,131
key-value that included with every
application

196
00:12:10,031 --> 00:12:15,038
it signed so Iowa snows the developer
really intended

197
00:12:15,038 --> 00:12:18,085
to include that information anything
that added

198
00:12:18,085 --> 00:12:23,172
or removed breaks the signature and code
signing on let it run

199
00:12:24,072 --> 00:12:27,124
with you know it or not your application
already includes

200
00:12:28,024 --> 00:12:31,041
the entitlement application identify

201
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:34,044
it and it automatically by Xcode and

202
00:12:34,071 --> 00:12:37,088
its value is in the form of team ID

203
00:12:37,088 --> 00:12:42,115
dot on blood & fire and it look
something like this:

204
00:12:43,015 --> 00:12:46,044
the two parts the team I T is

205
00:12:46,044 --> 00:12:49,045
a unique 10 character string issued

206
00:12:49,045 --> 00:12:54,081
to every developer and you can look it
up on the developer portal

207
00:12:54,081 --> 00:12:58,099
the bump identify part you actually
specified yourself from with an Xcode

208
00:12:58,099 --> 00:13:01,185
in the general identity section

209
00:13:02,085 --> 00:13:05,152
together the key mighty and bump like 10
to fire

210
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:10,058
create an application identify it unique
for every single

211
00:13:10,058 --> 00:13:15,139
I wesat out there so we can specify we
really want that one

212
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:19,044
today in I with 8 where announcing the
new

213
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:22,131
Associated remains entitlement

214
00:13:23,031 --> 00:13:26,110
its value has the former service coal on

215
00:13:27,001 --> 00:13:30,004
forty-four fully qualified domain name
optionally

216
00:13:30,013 --> 00:13:33,022
a port it'll look something like this

217
00:13:33,022 --> 00:13:40,022
because for best feature want the
service web credentials

218
00:13:40,064 --> 00:13:43,130
its easy to add value to this
entitlement there's a new section

219
00:13:44,003 --> 00:13:47,034
under the capabilities a tab Xcode

220
00:13:47,061 --> 00:13:50,124
Associated remains

221
00:13:51,024 --> 00:13:54,031
country dance all you need Association

222
00:13:54,031 --> 00:14:00,070
on the upside of things let's look at
what's needed service i'd

223
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:03,034
as I mentioned I less is going to be
requesting the Apple

224
00:14:03,097 --> 00:14:07,150
ap site Association file but if we just
get that far what's in it

225
00:14:08,005 --> 00:14:13,067
well it's just a bit binary blob but
inside is a very simple but a chase on

226
00:14:14,012 --> 00:14:17,019
there's dictionary which contains least

227
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:20,058
application identifies in

228
00:14:20,058 --> 00:14:24,065
the same way you could list multiple
domains in your entitlement

229
00:14:24,065 --> 00:14:27,113
you can list multiple application
identifiers

230
00:14:28,013 --> 00:14:31,020
in this file which allows a really
flexible

231
00:14:31,002 --> 00:14:34,101
many to many relationship

232
00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:39,060
the content-type returned by the web
server needs to be application

233
00:14:39,006 --> 00:14:43,063
PKcs 7 mine which means it's been signed

234
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:48,023
the signature is provided by CMS that's
the cryptographic message syntax

235
00:14:48,077 --> 00:14:52,161
which is the same format used by s/mime

236
00:14:53,061 --> 00:14:57,065
but to a quick look what it takes to
sign file

237
00:14:57,065 --> 00:15:00,091
so here's the Jason he saw a moment ago
but with all the white space removed

238
00:15:00,091 --> 00:15:05,093
and I'm saving it off into Jason doc txt

239
00:15:05,093 --> 00:15:09,135
next and providing it to open SSL s/mime
command

240
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:13,082
and feeding in the certificate and key

241
00:15:13,082 --> 00:15:16,084
provided by the CIA for our site

242
00:15:17,002 --> 00:15:20,081
this is almost certainly going to be the
same that is used by a web server

243
00:15:20,081 --> 00:15:23,123
but it doesn't have to be as long as
it's valid

244
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:30,072
for the site being associated in this
case example dot com

245
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:34,470
the output then is be Apple ap psych
Association file

246
00:15:34,047 --> 00:15:38,116
you can copy straight to Web server
hosting

247
00:15:39,016 --> 00:15:42,023
and when that's their that everything
you need to do

248
00:15:42,023 --> 00:15:45,029
except I O S is going to be making
requests of

249
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:48,085
the file from the web server and Web
servers can

250
00:15:48,085 --> 00:15:51,089
return different codes let's have a look
at

251
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:54,138
some other statuses

252
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:58,073
if the file exists only get 200 OK

253
00:15:58,073 --> 00:16:01,074
I wes is gonna take the file and check

254
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:04,122
the service name and application
identify match

255
00:16:05,022 --> 00:16:12,022
and the signatures valid and is it mark
lot ap two main path has approved

256
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,450
if it gets 200 OK but there's a problem
with any of those checks

257
00:16:16,045 --> 00:16:19,093
we go in market is denied

258
00:16:19,093 --> 00:16:22,097
likewise any in the 300 or 400 range

259
00:16:23,033 --> 00:16:26,035
like 301 302 redirect or

260
00:16:26,035 --> 00:16:29,464
404 file not found we gonna go straight
ahead

261
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:32,810
a market has denied

262
00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:37,490
anything and 500 range like a $500
internal server error

263
00:16:37,049 --> 00:16:40,091
we're going to just assume is temporary
glitch with the web server

264
00:16:40,091 --> 00:16:43,160
and retry its worth noting

265
00:16:44,006 --> 00:16:47,048
that this association and approval state
is removed

266
00:16:48,002 --> 00:16:52,003
anytime the application is uninstalled
by the user

267
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:55,046
which is really useful if you're
developing and testing and neater

268
00:16:55,046 --> 00:16:59,142
go to this of you a few times to get it
right

269
00:17:00,042 --> 00:17:03,075
so now we've set up the trust
relationship between

270
00:17:03,075 --> 00:17:06,077
ap on a Web site let's see how we can

271
00:17:06,077 --> 00:17:09,516
integrate prompting for safaris saved
passwords

272
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:15,306
into application flight

273
00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:19,182
here we are all home screen the shiny ap

274
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:22,222
just installed and waiting to be
launched

275
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:27,530
once launched its gonna go to this flow

276
00:17:27,053 --> 00:17:31,082
because we need the username and
password to log onto a backend server

277
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:33,330
right away

278
00:17:33,033 --> 00:17:37,041
the first thing it does is check to see
if we already have any saved

279
00:17:38,013 --> 00:17:41,018
they could be saved in the keychain as a
username and password

280
00:17:41,063 --> 00:17:45,102
could be no wolf token or cookie that we
can use to login

281
00:17:46,002 --> 00:17:48,911
because I just installed it there's
nothing there so we just gonna have to

282
00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:51,210
prompt the user

283
00:17:51,021 --> 00:17:54,025
one season has and to their credentials
then we can save them

284
00:17:54,061 --> 00:17:57,082
practicing the next time and then we can
login and

285
00:17:57,082 --> 00:18:03,173
see the wonderful shiny teapot T also
another one of my favorite things

286
00:18:04,073 --> 00:18:07,086
so next time come back and launch the
application on check

287
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,124
for safe credentials is going to be
successful and we can log

288
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:14,121
strated

289
00:18:15,021 --> 00:18:18,104
now let's go back to see what the first
user experience flows like

290
00:18:19,004 --> 00:18:22,010
when we can check the safe credentials
in Safari

291
00:18:22,064 --> 00:18:25,132
we just inserting another step again

292
00:18:26,032 --> 00:18:29,077
the app is gonna check it's a demanding
itself but if that isn't any

293
00:18:29,077 --> 00:18:32,176
we going to be prompted to see if they
have saved anything

294
00:18:33,076 --> 00:18:37,109
in Safari

295
00:18:38,009 --> 00:18:42,010
if they sweater credential reflect an
account the username and password is

296
00:18:42,019 --> 00:18:43,108
going to be returned to application

297
00:18:44,008 --> 00:18:47,051
which can exchange it for North spoken
save it in the keychain

298
00:18:47,051 --> 00:18:50,072
whatever is required by a back-end
server to authenticate

299
00:18:50,072 --> 00:18:53,134
and then you can log straight in

300
00:18:54,034 --> 00:18:57,043
it might be worth noting that you still
need the using the password view

301
00:18:58,024 --> 00:19:01,070
as a fallback in case the user haven't
saved anything

302
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:05,035
with Safari or declined to select one

303
00:19:05,098 --> 00:19:08,161
plus the flow now let's look at the APR
you can use to implement this

304
00:19:09,061 --> 00:19:12,063
we introducing three today

305
00:19:12,063 --> 00:19:15,080
sec request shared web credential sec

306
00:19:15,008 --> 00:19:18,009
and shared web credential and sec create

307
00:19:18,009 --> 00:19:21,108
shared web credential password

308
00:19:22,089 --> 00:19:25,160
the first is what causes the count
picketed to be displayed

309
00:19:26,006 --> 00:19:31,037
it has three arguments and the
completion block

310
00:19:31,091 --> 00:19:34,240
the first allows you to specify domain
name

311
00:19:35,059 --> 00:19:38,470
the second username if you already know
it somehow

312
00:19:38,047 --> 00:19:41,052
and then a completion block which will
be run

313
00:19:41,052 --> 00:19:44,097
after you use a has selected item

314
00:19:44,097 --> 00:19:49,103
all it has not been displayed for some
reason

315
00:19:50,003 --> 00:19:54,012
now already listed all those to maintain
your entitlement

316
00:19:54,012 --> 00:19:57,075
and you have usually no idea what user
names your

317
00:19:57,075 --> 00:20:00,130
uses half so what you can do is pop no

318
00:20:01,003 --> 00:20:04,061
for both the post first two fields

319
00:20:04,088 --> 00:20:07,149
passing null for the main just uses the
entitlement values

320
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:11,049
and popping all for the user name will
get

321
00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:16,618
anything that can be found any of the
domain to the entitlement

322
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:20,860
so whenever the code is executed we get
the pic /a

323
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:23,090
you just like the credential and

324
00:20:24,026 --> 00:20:27,051
the completion block runs into it

325
00:20:27,051 --> 00:20:32,104
is passed a data structure credentials
which contains the username and password

326
00:20:33,004 --> 00:20:36,022
and maybe era if anything's gone wrong

327
00:20:36,022 --> 00:20:39,096
let's look at some the code you might
want to include in such a completion

328
00:20:39,096 --> 00:20:39,138
block

329
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:43,074
and its again pretty straightforward we
just checking

330
00:20:43,074 --> 00:20:47,082
that there was no era and a credential
was returned

331
00:20:48,054 --> 00:20:52,061
we extract username and password from
the data structure

332
00:20:52,061 --> 00:20:56,000
a part of to the method that application
already had

333
00:20:56,549 --> 00:20:59,960
to log into the server because it is
running in a block

334
00:20:59,096 --> 00:21:03,935
I'm gonna run that on the main cue just
in case you need to deal with you on

335
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,940
are Eric condition down here will run

336
00:21:07,094 --> 00:21:10,186
if you didn't like the password or
they're just down there

337
00:21:11,086 --> 00:21:14,100
I'm gonna show the locking you why which
is awful back

338
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,021
and again dispatch that to the monkey

339
00:21:18,021 --> 00:21:21,990
and that's really all there is however
your application

340
00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:26,420
might allow a user to create an account
from within

341
00:21:26,042 --> 00:21:29,045
the native application and in this case
we need sick add

342
00:21:29,072 --> 00:21:32,121
shed with credentials

343
00:21:33,021 --> 00:21:36,115
this time you must specify domain name
and username

344
00:21:37,015 --> 00:21:40,108
and password as a completion block

345
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:44,085
but an error in this case usually means
there's something amiss

346
00:21:44,085 --> 00:21:47,157
with your app site linking and the
approval process so it more useful

347
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:52,064
during development if there are no
existing accounts in Safari

348
00:21:53,027 --> 00:21:57,034
when you call this this complete with no
you like just go straight in

349
00:21:57,034 --> 00:22:00,089
which makes it really easy to include in
your flow

350
00:22:00,089 --> 00:22:03,173
and make sure those credentials adjust
their the next time to use a go-to

351
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:05,022
website

352
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:11,200
in Safari i wish i cud keychain on any
of their devices

353
00:22:11,002 --> 00:22:14,060
if the user can change that password
from within an application

354
00:22:14,078 --> 00:22:18,127
make exactly the same call but just
apply the new password

355
00:22:19,027 --> 00:22:22,101
in this case with an existing item began
to prompt to make sure thats

356
00:22:23,001 --> 00:22:26,067
what the user wants to delete an account

357
00:22:26,067 --> 00:22:29,076
he just popped no as the password
argument

358
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,870
again use is going to be prompted

359
00:22:32,087 --> 00:22:35,170
note should only beat this if they
really on deleting their account to the

360
00:22:36,007 --> 00:22:37,024
just looking out

361
00:22:37,087 --> 00:22:40,092
then taken any their credentials next
time they look back in again

362
00:22:41,037 --> 00:22:44,124
or maybe already determined that those
credentials style

363
00:22:45,024 --> 00:22:49,036
and they wouldn't work anyway to finally
PRI

364
00:22:49,036 --> 00:22:53,050
simply returns a random password each
time it called

365
00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:56,184
its in the same format used by Safari

366
00:22:56,679 --> 00:23:00,660
returning for a moment to the completion
block

367
00:23:00,066 --> 00:23:03,115
there'll a number there is that can be
returned

368
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:07,062
and have a look at them now

369
00:23:07,062 --> 00:23:10,101
the first is a sec parampara

370
00:23:11,001 --> 00:23:14,029
and a description no demean provided

371
00:23:14,029 --> 00:23:17,288
what tends to be happening here

372
00:23:17,549 --> 00:23:21,250
is your parting no as your domain so we
can look at the entitlement

373
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:26,042
but the entitlement isn't there to get
the node two main provider

374
00:23:26,042 --> 00:23:29,045
could also get a missing entitlement era
and this mean

375
00:23:29,072 --> 00:23:34,125
you all specify a domain name but there
is no entitlement

376
00:23:35,025 --> 00:23:38,087
next you could get a sec item not found
error

377
00:23:38,087 --> 00:23:44,110
and this means that there is no approved
two main

378
00:23:45,001 --> 00:23:48,023
which is the same you get if just aren't
any

379
00:23:48,032 --> 00:23:51,040
but you are approved we were turning

380
00:23:51,004 --> 00:23:54,025
the same error condition for both of
these at the privacy feature

381
00:23:54,061 --> 00:23:57,084
which means that rogue applications and
never going to get

382
00:23:57,084 --> 00:24:02,803
any more information than they they
really does work

383
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:08,510
so now let's have a quick demo putting
it all into practice

384
00:24:08,051 --> 00:24:11,065
the first ball let's go to the shiny
website but

385
00:24:11,065 --> 00:24:17,474
I have actually gotten account yet so
I'm gonna sign up

386
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:22,330
Safari is suggesting to fell apart what
on going to accept that

387
00:24:22,033 --> 00:24:27,012
and ok today shiny thing is macaroons
that's gonna very well with the T

388
00:24:27,309 --> 00:24:30,395
so let's go over to ISL s and have a
look

389
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:34,600
I with native shiny ap well here it is

390
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:37,012
going to launch it and he will

391
00:24:38,002 --> 00:24:41,058
username and password so it was Andrew

392
00:24:41,076 --> 00:24:44,149
and I have no idea what it what came up
too quickly

393
00:24:45,049 --> 00:24:48,738
so let's go back and see if we can
change the application

394
00:24:49,179 --> 00:24:54,700
to fix that

395
00:24:54,007 --> 00:24:58,007
here we are in P Logan view controller

396
00:24:58,007 --> 00:25:01,034
and it is cool down a bit we got the
method login

397
00:25:01,097 --> 00:25:04,115
we'll catch credentials it possible

398
00:25:05,015 --> 00:25:11,034
it in turn is calling model with a local
keychain credentials as possible

399
00:25:11,034 --> 00:25:15,049
that takes to block the first will be
passed

400
00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:18,123
the username and password if there's one
in the keychain and the second

401
00:25:19,023 --> 00:25:22,029
is what's wrong on failure this no
credentials

402
00:25:22,029 --> 00:25:25,035
site so I'm going to create a new method

403
00:25:25,089 --> 00:25:31,138
two parallel this one

404
00:25:32,038 --> 00:25:35,207
log on with Safari credentials the
possible again taking

405
00:25:35,549 --> 00:25:38,600
success block and a failure block

406
00:25:38,006 --> 00:25:41,083
so this code is very similar to the one
I walked two in the slides

407
00:25:42,037 --> 00:25:47,066
lot into the calling the method directly
recording the success block

408
00:25:47,066 --> 00:25:53,149
and the failure block if those era 42
declined to select anything

409
00:25:54,049 --> 00:25:57,056
so now I'm back in the era block the
failure block

410
00:25:58,019 --> 00:26:01,076
a previous method and

411
00:26:01,076 --> 00:26:04,084
instead of the back and fullback

412
00:26:04,084 --> 00:26:11,084
being show log on you wind title mints
I'm gonna put a cold one method that

413
00:26:13,021 --> 00:26:16,083
and them in this way we have a cascade

414
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:20,086
all blocks so if there's nothing found
in the keychain

415
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:25,037
because of a lip-lock if there's no
Safari say credentials

416
00:26:25,037 --> 00:26:30,050
it calls its failure block which falls
back to locking you why

417
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:34,089
so what's a give this a bill didn't see
what happens

418
00:26:35,034 --> 00:26:39,493
to launch it and yes we gotta pick up

419
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:45,730
Morgan and never to date my current

420
00:26:45,073 --> 00:26:48,078
the app did provide a way for us to
change a password

421
00:26:48,078 --> 00:26:51,084
and it already pre filled one out from
the sec create

422
00:26:51,084 --> 00:26:55,102
shed web credential password so I can
accept that that looks

423
00:26:56,002 --> 00:27:00,151
reasonably secure change password and
because I already had something the

424
00:27:00,169 --> 00:27:00,770
keychain

425
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:03,154
its from to be gonna go head update

426
00:27:04,054 --> 00:27:07,933
that we are look straight in and

427
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:11,770
now

428
00:27:11,077 --> 00:27:16,079
come back to the Mac

429
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:19,122
all being well yes there we go i cud
keychain it on its magic

430
00:27:20,022 --> 00:27:24,049
and the username and password

431
00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:27,071
yes I thought he did has done its magic
the update a password

432
00:27:27,071 --> 00:27:34,030
is over there

433
00:27:34,669 --> 00:27:38,250
so though there are quite a few steps

434
00:27:38,025 --> 00:27:41,084
none at the mall particularly difficult
and it allows

435
00:27:41,309 --> 00:27:44,980
of maintaining a very very high level of
security

436
00:27:44,098 --> 00:27:48,175
this lost broken point in the
convenience and security ecosystem

437
00:27:49,075 --> 00:27:53,114
to be may complete

438
00:27:53,789 --> 00:28:00,080
thank you all

439
00:28:00,008 --> 00:28:05,022
thank center I am really excited to see
what you guys are gonna do with these

440
00:28:05,022 --> 00:28:05,731
API's

441
00:28:05,929 --> 00:28:09,780
it's really a personal pet peeve of mine
to get stopped in my tracks in a login

442
00:28:09,078 --> 00:28:09,847
screen

443
00:28:10,549 --> 00:28:13,625
and I'm really excited that if I've gone
the Safari create an account there

444
00:28:14,309 --> 00:28:17,700
to never see that again sec

445
00:28:17,007 --> 00:28:21,011
at shared web credential the API the
danger told you about the girl you step

446
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,088
add a password to the user's keychain

447
00:28:23,088 --> 00:28:26,127
update a password in the user's keychain
or two weeks

448
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:30,590
something it's really neat it's not me

449
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:34,062
just because what it's going to mean for
all of us in this room as users

450
00:28:34,062 --> 00:28:39,981
because it perfectly captures your
applications intent

451
00:28:40,539 --> 00:28:44,660
your app tells I'll ask exactly what I
want to happen to use his credentials

452
00:28:44,066 --> 00:28:47,575
and they're automatically synced across
all of a user's devices with i cud

453
00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:50,260
teaching

454
00:28:50,026 --> 00:28:53,083
it's not as clear-cut on the web.
however

455
00:28:53,083 --> 00:28:56,119
your website doesn't have a way of
saying hey Safari

456
00:28:57,019 --> 00:29:01,045
I just updated entries password from foo
to bar

457
00:29:01,045 --> 00:29:05,052
instead what Safari does is it uses a
series of jurisdiction in order to

458
00:29:05,052 --> 00:29:06,138
figure out what your website's doing

459
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:10,049
and update your users passwords
accordingly

460
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:13,057
and make this all work Safari needs to
understand

461
00:29:13,057 --> 00:29:17,113
your website's forms secure the flow
diagram

462
00:29:18,013 --> 00:29:22,100
how conceptually a password manager
could be looking at your web sites

463
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,001
users move between states like not
having an account

464
00:29:26,001 --> 00:29:30,008
registering for an account having the
account and logging in and out of it

465
00:29:30,071 --> 00:29:33,780
Safari does all of this automatically
there's nothing that you have to do

466
00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:38,590
there's no opting for re-analyzing your
website and offering password features

467
00:29:38,059 --> 00:29:39,068
to its users

468
00:29:40,049 --> 00:29:44,238
because this is automatic and it's using
heuristics

469
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:47,740
things can go wrong heuristics aren't
perfect

470
00:29:48,289 --> 00:29:52,770
and when things do go wrong continuity
breaks down for your users

471
00:29:52,077 --> 00:29:55,169
for instance if Safari didn't have a
password saved for your website

472
00:29:56,069 --> 00:29:59,113
when you cough sec request shared web
credential from thing I less ap

473
00:30:00,013 --> 00:30:04,076
gonna get back an empty array and if so
far did notice that user change their

474
00:30:04,076 --> 00:30:05,088
password on your site

475
00:30:05,088 --> 00:30:08,109
it so far I didn't understand that
happened when you cough sec request

476
00:30:09,009 --> 00:30:09,968
chaired by credential

477
00:30:10,049 --> 00:30:13,710
gonna go back a scale credential in your
users are going to be logged in

478
00:30:13,071 --> 00:30:15,071
effortlessly

479
00:30:15,071 --> 00:30:18,290
because it there it's an everyone's best
interest

480
00:30:18,929 --> 00:30:21,940
test their web sites with Safari
autofill

481
00:30:21,094 --> 00:30:24,138
fortunately it's really straightforward
to do this

482
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:28,109
all you have to do is pretend to be one
of your users for a few minutes

483
00:30:29,009 --> 00:30:32,040
let's go back to the state diagram

484
00:30:32,004 --> 00:30:35,163
the first thing going on do is get
yourself cleaned by circling user

485
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:35,634
account

486
00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:38,870
because you don't interfere with
whatever credentials you personally have

487
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:41,161
stored for the website for your building

488
00:30:42,061 --> 00:30:45,082
and then the first thing your gonna do
is create an account

489
00:30:45,082 --> 00:30:48,147
just like your users would got your
accounts Creek go to your website

490
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:50,084
account creation forms

491
00:30:50,084 --> 00:30:53,423
and sign up the two things that you're
looking for here

492
00:30:54,179 --> 00:30:57,600
are Safari offer to generate a random
credential for the user

493
00:30:57,006 --> 00:31:00,097
a random password and that after you've
created the account

494
00:31:01,051 --> 00:31:05,470
Safari saved the username and password
and the way your gonna check this

495
00:31:05,929 --> 00:31:10,850
is by an OS 10 opening up safaris
preferences going to the passwords pain

496
00:31:10,085 --> 00:31:14,122
and I'll ass you open settings and go to
the Safari section and you have finalist

497
00:31:15,022 --> 00:31:17,721
passwords and usernames that have been
saved

498
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:21,000
alright now you have an account

499
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,046
snatch em accounting a lot in the first
thing you're going to do

500
00:31:24,046 --> 00:31:27,073
is locked up and try to log back in
again

501
00:31:27,073 --> 00:31:30,252
when you go to your website login page
the thing you're looking for

502
00:31:30,909 --> 00:31:34,330
is that Safari pre-filled the
credentials City users have to take them

503
00:31:34,033 --> 00:31:36,033
in

504
00:31:36,033 --> 00:31:40,076
right we've done that next up users
gonna gonna change their passwords at

505
00:31:40,076 --> 00:31:41,098
some point

506
00:31:41,098 --> 00:31:44,146
during their relationship with your
website you're going to want to do that

507
00:31:45,046 --> 00:31:48,063
when you're logged in go to your change
password form

508
00:31:48,063 --> 00:31:50,151
and while you're there make sure the
Safari offer to generate a credential

509
00:31:51,051 --> 00:31:52,350
for users

510
00:31:52,809 --> 00:31:55,858
and its save the updated credential
appropriately go back to that list

511
00:31:56,299 --> 00:31:59,640
make sure that the new credential saved

512
00:31:59,064 --> 00:32:03,065
and finally if your website offers a way
for users to change their passwords when

513
00:32:03,074 --> 00:32:04,110
they forgot them

514
00:32:05,001 --> 00:32:08,002
go ahead and check back to you make sure
the Safari save

515
00:32:08,002 --> 00:32:11,009
a good credentials

516
00:32:11,027 --> 00:32:14,125
and finally to simulate a user having
started their relationship with your

517
00:32:15,025 --> 00:32:15,584
website

518
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:18,821
outside safaris watch delete the
credentials

519
00:32:18,929 --> 00:32:22,330
that you've created for this website
going to settings going so far as

520
00:32:22,033 --> 00:32:22,124
preferences

521
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:26,703
delete them then go back your login page

522
00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:30,920
manually enter them and make sure the
Safari save them at that point

523
00:32:30,929 --> 00:32:37,929
so that your users have a great
experience

524
00:32:38,179 --> 00:32:42,265
all right testings over hopefully
everything works perfectly

525
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:46,730
but if it didn't i'm happy to say that
we have to new strategies to tell you

526
00:32:46,073 --> 00:32:46,159
about today

527
00:32:47,059 --> 00:32:50,140
you could put into place on your
website's forms help Safari understand

528
00:32:51,004 --> 00:32:52,913
your website better

529
00:32:53,309 --> 00:32:57,394
the first one is about declaring your
forms intentions

530
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,197
new and Safari 8 on your sanity and
Safari and I'll SAT

531
00:33:02,539 --> 00:33:07,230
Safari supports three new values for the
autocomplete attribute

532
00:33:07,023 --> 00:33:10,120
username current password and new
password

533
00:33:11,002 --> 00:33:14,861
these are relatively recent addition to
the HTML specification

534
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:19,260
and it really easy to use just label
your username field as username

535
00:33:19,026 --> 00:33:22,825
any field but asking for the user's
current password is current password

536
00:33:23,059 --> 00:33:27,220
and you guessed it a new password is
your password fitzwater few samples at

537
00:33:27,022 --> 00:33:28,025
this

538
00:33:28,025 --> 00:33:31,058
here's a standard login form you're
probably asking for the users username

539
00:33:31,058 --> 00:33:32,065
and password

540
00:33:32,065 --> 00:33:35,128
go ahead label them in for type text
username

541
00:33:36,028 --> 00:33:41,057
are complete with his name and label the
password field current password

542
00:33:41,057 --> 00:33:44,064
I whatever form users create account
pretty similar

543
00:33:45,027 --> 00:33:49,176
just label the field as username and new
password and safaris can understand your

544
00:33:49,419 --> 00:33:50,580
forms a little bit better

545
00:33:50,058 --> 00:33:54,124
and be sure to offer password generation
for users

546
00:33:55,024 --> 00:33:57,119
if you want your users to confirm their
passwords to make sure they entered them

547
00:33:58,019 --> 00:33:58,083
the right way

548
00:33:58,083 --> 00:34:01,108
of times it's fine just go ahead and
labeled of

549
00:34:02,008 --> 00:34:06,011
your password field and Confirm Password
field as new password

550
00:34:06,011 --> 00:34:09,540
and safaris can understand that better
as well

551
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:12,641
and now changing passwords that's fine

552
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:14,710
you can wanna know the user's current
password to prove that they are who they

553
00:34:15,169 --> 00:34:16,171
say they are

554
00:34:16,369 --> 00:34:19,394
and you're gonna want a new password has
that's the point just use current

555
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:19,693
password

556
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:24,456
a new password something you might
notice about the slide

557
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:29,330
is that I'm specifically outputting the
current users username

558
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:32,472
within the form this is a really good
idea

559
00:34:32,859 --> 00:34:37,925
because what this does is it tell Safari
which user is having a password updated

560
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:41,573
this is really important if users have
more than one account on your site

561
00:34:42,059 --> 00:34:45,076
but it's just a good idea in general now

562
00:34:45,229 --> 00:34:48,236
if your design doesn't accommodate the
sort of thing putting the user name out

563
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:50,950
in plain text read only like this

564
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:54,163
don't worry about it just change the
input from type text

565
00:34:54,379 --> 00:34:57,420
type hidden your users are going to see
a

566
00:34:57,042 --> 00:35:00,116
but safari is and safaris can understand
your forms better

567
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:06,095
and do a better job ensuring continuity
with respect to your use his credentials

568
00:35:06,095 --> 00:35:10,120
and finally the Forgot Password case in
this case

569
00:35:11,002 --> 00:35:15,046
you might want to know the username same
things forcing caveat you can hide it

570
00:35:15,064 --> 00:35:20,233
and this time all you want a new
password so label it that way

571
00:35:20,809 --> 00:35:24,840
these three new values add to an already
long list of values that you could use

572
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,680
with the autocomplete attribute

573
00:35:26,068 --> 00:35:30,647
to help Safari understand your forms and
your intentions better

574
00:35:31,259 --> 00:35:34,333
so for instance given input element and
you label it autocomplete

575
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:38,160
phone when the user uses

576
00:35:38,016 --> 00:35:41,865
autofilter fill out the form you're
gonna be saying hey sorry

577
00:35:42,009 --> 00:35:45,063
when you're on a feeling this please put
the phone number here please don't put

578
00:35:45,549 --> 00:35:46,581
anything else

579
00:35:46,869 --> 00:35:49,878
and safaris gonna do it right okeydoke

580
00:35:50,769 --> 00:35:53,821
that was the first technique I wanna
tell you about make Safari understand

581
00:35:54,289 --> 00:35:55,420
your forms better

582
00:35:55,042 --> 00:35:58,211
and it's pretty universally applicable i
mean you could use it on any website

583
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:00,631
that has forms

584
00:36:01,009 --> 00:36:05,010
the second technique I want to tell you
about is a little more specialized

585
00:36:05,019 --> 00:36:09,700
specialized because it has to do with a
certain type of web application

586
00:36:09,007 --> 00:36:12,082
and that's the kind of web application
that loads content dynamically

587
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:16,564
the exit charging using javascript you
know these pages

588
00:36:16,969 --> 00:36:20,190
they don't of all page refresh when you
click on a link everything to snaps and

589
00:36:20,019 --> 00:36:21,041
instantly

590
00:36:21,041 --> 00:36:25,480
these pages are great for users this
dynamism is awesome

591
00:36:25,849 --> 00:36:28,867
but it's that same kind of dynamism no
four-page transition

592
00:36:29,029 --> 00:36:32,032
makes it a little bit harder for Safari
to understand that one of these

593
00:36:32,329 --> 00:36:34,650
transitions in the password state
diagram

594
00:36:34,065 --> 00:36:39,204
happened fortunately using some of the
same API's

595
00:36:39,789 --> 00:36:43,440
you're probably already using to build
this web applications

596
00:36:43,044 --> 00:36:45,141
those API to get off our to something
interesting happened with the user's

597
00:36:46,041 --> 00:36:47,850
credentials

598
00:36:48,219 --> 00:36:51,225
we're talking about is history and
histories pushed a

599
00:36:51,279 --> 00:36:54,298
and replace statements what you do with
these

600
00:36:54,469 --> 00:36:57,471
is you contribute to the browser's back
forward left

601
00:36:57,489 --> 00:37:01,522
so funny user on your site and I click
three links when I hit the back button

602
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:05,822
if you're not using this you go back
three-page it's not a single page

603
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:09,162
if you're using pushed a your adding
state to the back far left

604
00:37:09,549 --> 00:37:12,900
the only go back one-page

605
00:37:12,009 --> 00:37:15,728
specifically push state and replaced a
take a data object

606
00:37:16,619 --> 00:37:19,666
which represents the current state if
your web application this is what you're

607
00:37:20,089 --> 00:37:21,150
gonna get back

608
00:37:21,015 --> 00:37:25,018
when you listen for the pop state event
when the user hits the back button

609
00:37:25,018 --> 00:37:29,020
that event a fire you go ahead every set
up the state as if the user has just

610
00:37:29,002 --> 00:37:32,831
hit back in motor home page

611
00:37:33,029 --> 00:37:37,054
as a user it's really easy to think
about the back forward left as a left to

612
00:37:37,279 --> 00:37:37,334
right

613
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:41,900
or right to left syriza pages I want to
encourage you to change your thinking on

614
00:37:42,539 --> 00:37:43,622
this

615
00:37:44,369 --> 00:37:48,930
really what the back forward list is is
to first active user state

616
00:37:48,093 --> 00:37:51,432
and with pushed a and replaced a your
dynamic

617
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:56,328
html5 JavaScript driven XHR never reload
awesome web application

618
00:37:56,859 --> 00:38:00,859
can go ahead and add to it cell

619
00:38:00,859 --> 00:38:04,650
the next time that the user is under
dynamic website and I gotta change their

620
00:38:04,065 --> 00:38:05,114
password

621
00:38:06,014 --> 00:38:09,095
just call push state once the password
change has succeeded

622
00:38:09,095 --> 00:38:12,654
this way safaris gonna know that's a
really good time to propped about

623
00:38:13,509 --> 00:38:16,591
saving it updated password saying it
looks like you just change your password

624
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:21,150
are you sure you want to do this and
remember

625
00:38:21,015 --> 00:38:24,039
history API and everything I showed you
really only comes into play after

626
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:25,088
building one of these dynamic

627
00:38:25,088 --> 00:38:28,747
JavaScript driven applications if when
you click on a link or do something else

628
00:38:29,539 --> 00:38:31,560
a full page reload happens

629
00:38:31,749 --> 00:38:35,150
I don't worry about this

630
00:38:35,015 --> 00:38:39,064
cell by testing your website with Safari
autofill

631
00:38:39,064 --> 00:38:42,493
finding any problems and trying to fix
them with the two new techniques I told

632
00:38:43,069 --> 00:38:43,900
you about

633
00:38:43,009 --> 00:38:46,078
you're gonna do a better job ensuring
continuity with respect to user's

634
00:38:46,969 --> 00:38:48,031
credentials

635
00:38:48,589 --> 00:38:51,614
their passwords automatically fill in
all be logged in all their devices and

636
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:52,880
Safari

637
00:38:52,088 --> 00:38:55,527
and your I les applications will have
access to great passwords

638
00:38:56,319 --> 00:38:59,400
in Sec request shared web credential

639
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:02,603
but if these two techniques not solve
all of your problems one gonna do was

640
00:39:02,999 --> 00:39:04,650
encourage you to please

641
00:39:04,065 --> 00:39:07,144
file a bug if you file a bug

642
00:39:07,729 --> 00:39:10,732
we might be able to give you a
workaround for your problem

643
00:39:10,759 --> 00:39:13,880
and regardless of whether we can give
you a workaround

644
00:39:13,088 --> 00:39:16,217
your real-world test case your problem

645
00:39:17,009 --> 00:39:20,045
is exactly what we need to make Safari
heuristics better

646
00:39:20,369 --> 00:39:23,400
real-world test cases make everything
better for everyone

647
00:39:23,004 --> 00:39:28,613
so please file box I promise that we'll
use them

648
00:39:29,009 --> 00:39:34,160
so I was awful ensuring continuity with
respect your user's credentials

649
00:39:34,016 --> 00:39:38,395
next thing I want to tell you about his
ways the Safari promote your website

650
00:39:38,539 --> 00:39:41,547
as Violet 7 afar user start page

651
00:39:41,619 --> 00:39:46,670
is a nice friendly easily capitalist
abusers hand-picked favorite

652
00:39:46,067 --> 00:39:50,436
and I'll SAT we augmented that view to
contain a few sites that the users

653
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:53,041
visited frequently

654
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:59,150
and Safari analyst 10 yosemite shares
that same start page design

655
00:39:59,015 --> 00:40:02,694
the quality of the icon for your website
that shows up here

656
00:40:02,829 --> 00:40:06,180
can make a huge difference its a first
impression and can make

657
00:40:06,018 --> 00:40:10,019
all the difference between a user
promoting

658
00:40:10,019 --> 00:40:14,408
a frequently visited site to a favorite
or removing it outright

659
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:17,630
and I bet that you in your team's sweat

660
00:40:18,089 --> 00:40:21,910
over your application's icon for hire
less from the senate to the App Store

661
00:40:21,091 --> 00:40:24,200
and it's time to do the same exact thing
for your website

662
00:40:25,019 --> 00:40:28,074
let's get into the details have
specified icons

663
00:40:28,569 --> 00:40:32,583
first up Afcon website probably have a
favicon

664
00:40:32,709 --> 00:40:35,773
shows up in the address bar next to a
website address on August 10

665
00:40:36,349 --> 00:40:39,413
on website about specifying Kabir Khan's
for a long time

666
00:40:39,989 --> 00:40:43,017
it's really easy little bit markup in
your pages head section

667
00:40:43,269 --> 00:40:46,315
or a standard half an hour on your file
server

668
00:40:46,729 --> 00:40:50,729
and spars can affect that but for the
start page %uh

669
00:40:50,729 --> 00:40:53,827
I'll ass and OS 10 what you're really
gonna wanna specify

670
00:40:54,709 --> 00:40:58,690
is what's called Apple touch icon you
might already be specifying this

671
00:40:58,069 --> 00:41:01,918
because this is the icon it's used when
a user ads your website

672
00:41:02,539 --> 00:41:05,610
to their home screen I less three Li
easy to do this

673
00:41:06,249 --> 00:41:10,254
simple link tag inside the head section
and you can even specify multiple love

674
00:41:10,299 --> 00:41:10,660
these

675
00:41:10,066 --> 00:41:13,138
with different sizes so there an
application like Safari

676
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:17,627
only downloads the one that it needs
down that's the lowest resolution one

677
00:41:17,969 --> 00:41:18,640
possible

678
00:41:18,064 --> 00:41:22,069
conserving band with for users for
information on the sizing

679
00:41:22,069 --> 00:41:25,188
and encourage you to check out
configuring web applications on Safari

680
00:41:25,809 --> 00:41:28,840
web content guide

681
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,135
to the reason for using Apple touch
icons for the start page

682
00:41:32,279 --> 00:41:35,287
is because there are you a ton of them
out there and there are ready you

683
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:39,444
the right resolution to be shown on a
Mac and i OS device

684
00:41:40,209 --> 00:41:43,430
don't let the park with us Touch and
Apple to check on weird you out with the

685
00:41:43,043 --> 00:41:43,139
last 10

686
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:47,114
just think of this as your web site icon

687
00:41:48,014 --> 00:41:52,653
and about the icon itself use every
single pixel in the square canvas

688
00:41:52,779 --> 00:41:53,860
available to you

689
00:41:54,589 --> 00:41:57,678
safaris gonna show all of those pixels
and if a user does

690
00:41:58,479 --> 00:42:01,490
head and adds your website to the home
screen I less

691
00:42:01,589 --> 00:42:05,601
or you know that icons around of I'll
wes is gonna handle that for you

692
00:42:05,709 --> 00:42:09,710
so there's no need for you to mask the
image we don't wanna have mismatched

693
00:42:09,809 --> 00:42:11,851
corner radii

694
00:42:12,229 --> 00:42:16,242
and finally now that Safari on OS 10 is
using Apple touch icons

695
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:20,380
you gonna put Apple touch icon mark-up
on all of your pages

696
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:23,527
not just the ones that you're serving to
mobile devices

697
00:42:23,869 --> 00:42:27,200
miss really no cost to doing this a
little bit of markup

698
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:30,111
and only devices that care about the
icon are gonna go ahead and download

699
00:42:30,309 --> 00:42:32,640
them

700
00:42:32,064 --> 00:42:35,273
alright that icons the first impression

701
00:42:35,849 --> 00:42:39,926
how your web site is seen by users in
Safari

702
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:43,680
let's talk about other ways that Safari
permits or content

703
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:48,285
Safari today is more than just the way
the people browse the web

704
00:42:48,789 --> 00:42:52,815
safar users ad pages to read later using
reading list

705
00:42:53,049 --> 00:42:56,920
the after party cleanup articles for
them to read later or right now

706
00:42:56,092 --> 00:42:59,411
using Safari reader

707
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:04,268
and on August 10 maverick's in Iowa 7 a
feature called shared links

708
00:43:04,529 --> 00:43:08,558
lets the user find articles to read find
other stuff that's interesting

709
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:12,900
ever shared on social networks well new

710
00:43:12,009 --> 00:43:16,438
to Safari 8 analyst 10 yosemite and I'll
SAT

711
00:43:17,329 --> 00:43:20,343
your website can participate in shared
thanks

712
00:43:20,469 --> 00:43:24,523
this works as you might expect using
your web site's RSS feed

713
00:43:25,009 --> 00:43:28,640
so as soon as a user chooses subscribing
shared links

714
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:31,183
I'll SROs 10 safaris gonna periodically

715
00:43:31,759 --> 00:43:35,762
picture feed and show that content to
users

716
00:43:35,789 --> 00:43:42,789
the content that shown in the sidebar is
directly taken from your rss feeds

717
00:43:43,269 --> 00:43:46,318
something the note here is that you
wanna serve your rss feeds

718
00:43:46,759 --> 00:43:50,765
and the markup Insider Pages head
sections to let browsers detect them

719
00:43:50,819 --> 00:43:54,400
all devices even mobile once

720
00:43:54,004 --> 00:43:58,031
Safari on iphone is just as capable of
participating in shared links

721
00:43:58,067 --> 00:44:01,088
as Safari on Mac

722
00:44:01,088 --> 00:44:04,297
turn our attention back to reading list
even if your site doesn't have an RSS

723
00:44:05,089 --> 00:44:05,900
feed

724
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:08,057
users can add your content to their
reading list

725
00:44:09,038 --> 00:44:14,217
and as you might know many view in the
audience as a I left seven

726
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:17,608
your application can add to users
reading list

727
00:44:18,049 --> 00:44:22,072
piece a cake all you have to do is
important Safari services framework

728
00:44:22,279 --> 00:44:25,310
and call a single method the text URL a
title

729
00:44:25,589 --> 00:44:30,150
and some preview text because you're
specifying the title in the preview text

730
00:44:30,015 --> 00:44:33,934
you're in complete control the holdup

731
00:44:34,069 --> 00:44:38,380
the situation shirt and a little bit
familiar to you

732
00:44:38,038 --> 00:44:42,045
yet again it's not always clear-cut and
how to express the sort of concepts

733
00:44:42,045 --> 00:44:45,384
on the web a page on your website
doesn't have a way of saying

734
00:44:45,789 --> 00:44:49,847
when I'm added to reading list use this
as my title and this is my description

735
00:44:50,369 --> 00:44:53,443
it can't say exactly that but they're
are things that your web pages can say

736
00:44:54,109 --> 00:44:59,190
that help them out so let's look at an
example of this

737
00:44:59,019 --> 00:45:02,588
hear some markup taken from the WebKit
blog recent blog post about

738
00:45:02,759 --> 00:45:06,150
fourth here lol VM jet that makes
JavaScript in Safari

739
00:45:06,015 --> 00:45:11,016
superfast encourage you to read it's an
awesome blog post

740
00:45:11,016 --> 00:45:14,395
that title doesn't really work as a
title of the user's page

741
00:45:14,539 --> 00:45:18,640
because has bread crumbs surfin Safari
archive

742
00:45:18,064 --> 00:45:22,703
but here using Open Graph meta data
standard I've put markup on the page

743
00:45:23,279 --> 00:45:26,335
clearly expresses a good title and a
good description

744
00:45:26,839 --> 00:45:29,906
same really simple to use

745
00:45:30,509 --> 00:45:33,640
and when your website speaks with
intention the strong

746
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:37,693
safari is going to listen because you
express the exact information insofar as

747
00:45:38,269 --> 00:45:39,200
looking for

748
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:44,811
Safari can rely on you rather than using
heuristics to get the job done

749
00:45:45,009 --> 00:45:48,086
there are other ways of specifying the
same sorta data here some markup you may

750
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:50,781
be familiar with your web developer

751
00:45:50,979 --> 00:45:54,991
med name description this is one way
that you might be specifying a

752
00:45:55,099 --> 00:45:56,390
description to let's say

753
00:45:56,039 --> 00:45:59,138
search engines for your pages on your
site

754
00:45:59,489 --> 00:46:02,562
Safari can listen to this too because
the concepts are closely aligned

755
00:46:03,219 --> 00:46:08,630
your site scription and reading this
disruption

756
00:46:08,063 --> 00:46:11,222
open graph is just one meta-data
standard

757
00:46:11,789 --> 00:46:15,795
you should be checking out today there
are a bunch of them on the web

758
00:46:15,849 --> 00:46:18,916
and this example with reading listening
getting better titles and descriptions

759
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:22,566
is just one example of how many data
could help you out today

760
00:46:22,989 --> 00:46:26,900
browsers search engines other web sites

761
00:46:26,009 --> 00:46:29,038
they're all gonna find uses for this
meta data in the future as they display

762
00:46:30,019 --> 00:46:31,098
your content

763
00:46:31,269 --> 00:46:34,271
to try to make it more attractive to
users so I encourage you to check this

764
00:46:34,469 --> 00:46:35,495
format out

765
00:46:35,729 --> 00:46:39,765
I think about adopting a medida strategy

766
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:43,640
okeydoke checkpoint by now

767
00:46:43,064 --> 00:46:47,088
you've added this simple file to your
web server if adopted entitlements

768
00:46:47,088 --> 00:46:50,577
in your eyelash application and your
ensuring continuity with respect your

769
00:46:51,369 --> 00:46:51,467
user's credentials

770
00:46:52,349 --> 00:46:56,350
making easy for them to log in your app
you tested for part of it

771
00:46:56,359 --> 00:46:59,940
you made it work great on your website
your icons are awesome

772
00:46:59,094 --> 00:47:02,413
just as good as rap icons and you've
adopted some meta data

773
00:47:03,259 --> 00:47:07,410
so that website browsers and search
engines understand your web content

774
00:47:07,041 --> 00:47:09,660
better

775
00:47:10,029 --> 00:47:13,650
for the rest of our time together I
wanna go over a few examples of how we

776
00:47:13,065 --> 00:47:13,744
can make

777
00:47:14,329 --> 00:47:19,400
your website have a great experience
when transitioning between devices

778
00:47:19,004 --> 00:47:25,573
users viewing your web site on mobile
devices and desktop devices

779
00:47:25,969 --> 00:47:31,180
the first example if I wanna talk about
is called be sticky mobile website

780
00:47:31,018 --> 00:47:35,137
sometime in a problem I just ran into
the other day hate this all the time

781
00:47:35,299 --> 00:47:39,640
but actually just happened last week my
friend was reading an article

782
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:43,064
on her iPhone look good to her she
thought that I might like it

783
00:47:43,064 --> 00:47:46,383
so she sent me a link to it I'm sitting
at my Mac

784
00:47:46,959 --> 00:47:49,960
and I opened it up and this is what I
saw

785
00:47:49,969 --> 00:47:53,023
I saw the website Mobile layout stretch
up

786
00:47:53,509 --> 00:47:57,566
super wide with my for texts that are
completely unreadable

787
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:02,430
another website when I run into this
problem i've seen this version of it

788
00:48:02,043 --> 00:48:06,138
where the content is constraint is say
320 points

789
00:48:07,038 --> 00:48:10,757
this is unreadable either cell

790
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:14,161
what I was able to do with this problem
was look at the website address

791
00:48:14,719 --> 00:48:19,751
the page that I was on and notice that I
was on a mobile specific subduing at the

792
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:20,132
site

793
00:48:20,969 --> 00:48:24,890
and that by removing m dot from the URL

794
00:48:24,089 --> 00:48:27,138
I could get a version of the website the
look great on a desktop

795
00:48:28,038 --> 00:48:31,367
with a nice constraint with so

796
00:48:31,709 --> 00:48:34,716
some of our users going to be able to
figure some other stuff out

797
00:48:34,779 --> 00:48:38,400
but they shouldn't have to and most of
them what

798
00:48:38,004 --> 00:48:42,573
let's get to the bottom of this problem
figure out how to fix it

799
00:48:42,969 --> 00:48:46,056
here's what I think what happened the
concept diagram

800
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:50,856
might not be exactly the same from site
to site but the big picture

801
00:48:51,009 --> 00:48:54,890
and what happened here is it the user my
friend

802
00:48:54,089 --> 00:48:58,188
went to a link on her iPhone when she
went to example that common this case

803
00:48:59,088 --> 00:49:03,091
the website said hate I can tell you're
on an iPhone from your user agent string

804
00:49:03,091 --> 00:49:06,210
I'm gonna send you to a mobile version
of the site because I think that's

805
00:49:07,029 --> 00:49:08,910
better for you

806
00:49:08,091 --> 00:49:12,940
and then she sent me a link to that
mobile version of the site

807
00:49:13,759 --> 00:49:16,762
and I went straight to the mobile site
it didn't have the kind of thing

808
00:49:16,789 --> 00:49:17,857
courtesy to write me back up

809
00:49:18,469 --> 00:49:22,483
to the desktop version site and now

810
00:49:22,609 --> 00:49:25,652
with hand of on OS 10 yosemite and Iowa
City

811
00:49:26,039 --> 00:49:28,135
it only takes one person to reproduce
this problem you don't need friends

812
00:49:28,999 --> 00:49:30,880
sending links to each other

813
00:49:30,088 --> 00:49:33,787
so there's even more reason than ever
before to get

814
00:49:34,579 --> 00:49:38,420
your URL strategy together

815
00:49:38,042 --> 00:49:42,411
the solution this case I alluded to it
earlier it's pretty simple

816
00:49:42,789 --> 00:49:46,811
let the mobile website route users back
to the desktop web site

817
00:49:47,009 --> 00:49:50,057
giving me the version of the website
that's appropriate

818
00:49:50,489 --> 00:49:53,547
iMac 27 inch Cinema Display

819
00:49:54,069 --> 00:49:57,120
for this would've solved by immediate
problem but there is a much better

820
00:49:57,579 --> 00:49:59,390
solution to be had

821
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:04,040
and that comes by admitting at the time
of the mobile website

822
00:50:04,004 --> 00:50:08,183
is over using technologies like
responsive design

823
00:50:08,579 --> 00:50:12,588
and layout html5 CSS you can make one
version of your website

824
00:50:13,479 --> 00:50:16,940
the looks awesome for all of your users
whether they're on an iPhone

825
00:50:16,094 --> 00:50:19,153
an iPad or a neck

826
00:50:19,999 --> 00:50:25,002
i'm happy to say we have a full session
on responsive design this year

827
00:50:25,029 --> 00:50:28,100
and you should check it out it's Friday
morning and if you're interested in this

828
00:50:28,739 --> 00:50:32,801
and you have a mobile website you're
gonna wanna go to that

829
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:36,930
okay one more topic to talk about

830
00:50:36,093 --> 00:50:40,642
and that's video since the dawn of
iPhone

831
00:50:41,479 --> 00:50:45,556
users have been grading getting amazing
video on the I left devices

832
00:50:46,249 --> 00:50:49,250
and that amazing video has been coming
to them without the use a

833
00:50:49,259 --> 00:50:52,342
any browser plug-ins using
standards-based video

834
00:50:53,089 --> 00:50:56,188
and because if this users have been
getting excellent battery life

835
00:50:57,079 --> 00:51:02,098
and smell video playback even on
relatively low power devices

836
00:51:02,269 --> 00:51:07,271
for a consistent unbroken experience for
how users get video on your site

837
00:51:07,289 --> 00:51:11,900
you should use the same video strategy
analyst Ken it works just as well there

838
00:51:11,009 --> 00:51:14,858
gives users better battery life and
smooth playback

839
00:51:15,749 --> 00:51:18,846
and if the reason it maybe you might be
avoiding losing the plugins on

840
00:51:19,719 --> 00:51:23,721
the desktop is because a maybe pre-roll
advertising or some other

841
00:51:23,739 --> 00:51:28,170
interactive component you can do that
today with Javascript HTML

842
00:51:28,017 --> 00:51:31,176
and video it's really simple

843
00:51:31,329 --> 00:51:34,405
for more information on advanced media
for the web you should check out

844
00:51:35,089 --> 00:51:38,133
actually you should have checked out the
session this morning at 11:30

845
00:51:38,529 --> 00:51:41,600
go back and watch the video if you
weren't there

846
00:51:42,239 --> 00:51:45,298
okay so in the last 50 minutes

847
00:51:45,829 --> 00:51:49,910
we've covered quite a bit and all of it
has been about ensuring

848
00:51:49,091 --> 00:51:53,680
continuity unbroken consistent
experiences

849
00:51:54,499 --> 00:51:58,140
for all of our users but that they're
using our products and services

850
00:51:58,014 --> 00:52:03,133
with a nap with the website and no
matter which device there on

851
00:52:03,259 --> 00:52:06,315
salary cap here's what I want you all to
go out and do today

852
00:52:06,819 --> 00:52:10,827
first things first but the sign Jason
file on your server

853
00:52:11,619 --> 00:52:15,880
at the entitlement your application and
call the API's to make sure that nobody

854
00:52:15,088 --> 00:52:16,089
in this room

855
00:52:16,089 --> 00:52:20,208
ever see the login screen and I a less
after when they created their account

856
00:52:21,009 --> 00:52:25,037
on the website and Safari and Safari has
credentials

857
00:52:25,289 --> 00:52:28,670
next thing to make sure that those
credentials that you're getting back

858
00:52:28,067 --> 00:52:32,256
from sac request shared web credential
are always up to date

859
00:52:32,859 --> 00:52:36,868
test your website with Safari autofill
everything might work rate

860
00:52:36,949 --> 00:52:40,960
but you should run into the problems
before users do if there are any

861
00:52:41,059 --> 00:52:45,140
and if there are look at the two
techniques that I told you about today

862
00:52:45,014 --> 00:52:49,103
no matter what kind of website you have
you should adopt autocomplete attributes

863
00:52:49,229 --> 00:52:52,277
and use username current password a new
password

864
00:52:52,709 --> 00:52:55,766
to make easier for Safari to do the
right thing with your forms

865
00:52:56,279 --> 00:53:00,372
in my only take five minutes and it'll
make a huge difference for users

866
00:53:01,209 --> 00:53:04,380
then sweat the details on your
application's icon

867
00:53:04,038 --> 00:53:07,887
make your website's icon look as great
as that after APs

868
00:53:08,229 --> 00:53:11,305
and then look at midday to find ways to
make web browsers

869
00:53:11,989 --> 00:53:16,018
search engines and other web sites
understand your content better

870
00:53:16,279 --> 00:53:19,630
for when they're showing it to users and
then

871
00:53:19,063 --> 00:53:22,063
think about your desktop and mobile
website if you have two different

872
00:53:22,063 --> 00:53:24,252
versions of your website

873
00:53:24,819 --> 00:53:29,150
try to have fun you want more
information on any of this

874
00:53:29,015 --> 00:53:32,384
I encourage you to get in touch with
evangelism

875
00:53:32,519 --> 00:53:35,670
ETF won support forums

876
00:53:35,067 --> 00:53:38,456
I got some really correlated sessions
this year some of which I pointed out

877
00:53:39,059 --> 00:53:40,170
earlier

878
00:53:40,017 --> 00:53:43,068
advance media for the web touch it.

879
00:53:43,068 --> 00:53:47,927
with and keychain adopting handoff to
make the smooth transitions

880
00:53:48,539 --> 00:53:52,593
just like use of crack in mail and
designing responsive web sites

881
00:53:53,079 --> 00:53:55,131
thank you so much everybody hope you
have an awesome WABC
