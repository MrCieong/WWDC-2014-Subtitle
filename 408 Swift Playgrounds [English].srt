1
00:00:11,031 --> 00:00:14,037
hi welcome to Swift playgrounds I'm Rick
Ballard

2
00:00:14,091 --> 00:00:17,095
and with me today is my colleague under
walk a mile we're both engineers are the

3
00:00:18,031 --> 00:00:18,102
expert team

4
00:00:19,002 --> 00:00:23,029
we've been working hard to bring
playgrounds for life richard is preggers

5
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:24,358
the world Monday morning

6
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:27,930
you talk a little bit more about the
Monday afternoon and yesterday

7
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:31,149
work today going to going to a lot more
depth we're gonna start today with some

8
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:33,073
conceptual background

9
00:00:33,073 --> 00:00:36,076
what playgrounds actually are and what
you can use them for

10
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:41,010
and then we'll show you examples how do
you stay grid for learning exploration

11
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:45,042
and visualization and the result if your
cur we'll show you how you can use your

12
00:00:45,051 --> 00:00:47,072
own custom resources with your
playground

13
00:00:47,072 --> 00:00:50,080
and how to use program for algorithm
development

14
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:54,087
and development other several pieces of
code were introduced the XT playground

15
00:00:55,059 --> 00:00:55,115
framework

16
00:00:56,015 --> 00:00:59,026
which include some really powerful
utilities that you can use to enhance

17
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:00,027
your playgrounds

18
00:01:00,036 --> 00:01:03,083
and we'll show you how you can develop
your own custom Quick Looks

19
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:06,172
to the you can visualize your own
classes the same way you visualize the

20
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,147
clashes that come with the frameworks

21
00:01:09,047 --> 00:01:13,079
next we'll show you a great day my love
how awesome playgrounds are for

22
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:16,124
developing custom views and any other
kind of custom drawing

23
00:01:17,024 --> 00:01:20,039
and we'll show you how you can use your
own a synchronous code

24
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:24,118
fragrance finally will finish up to date
with a little bit back

25
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:29,523
limitations apply contact today so what
exactly are playgrounds

26
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:33,090
records our new type of document
introduced in Xcode sex

27
00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:36,877
and they're actually a fire rapper
containing a few useful things

28
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:40,464
first ball is your script code the code
will be run

29
00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:44,054
and resort I and generate results to
display automatically

30
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:47,648
every tiny editor program file swiss
burger

31
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:53,060
also contain a folder embedded resources
which are made available to your code

32
00:01:53,006 --> 00:01:56,355
or your program can reference resources
elsewhere on your system you wanna make

33
00:01:56,409 --> 00:01:57,130
available

34
00:01:57,013 --> 00:02:00,078
finally your pecker can contain a time
line

35
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,087
fourth time in items to provide used for
visualization

36
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:09,720
view results yard what you see in the
sidebar when you first open a playground

37
00:02:09,072 --> 00:02:10,109
we show the playground editor

38
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:14,988
with your swift code on the left &
Resorts sidebar on the right

39
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:19,240
showing the result every expression in
your code every tiny

40
00:02:19,024 --> 00:02:23,043
edit your source rerun your playground
source from the top to the bottom

41
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:26,122
and protect the new results from that
run in the sidebar

42
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:32,321
this is the basic editor mode but if you
go into the assistant editor mode

43
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:36,580
will show the time line assisted by
default which allows you to visualize a

44
00:02:36,058 --> 00:02:37,101
result in more detail

45
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:42,025
for example you can display the value
history from a light in your code

46
00:02:42,025 --> 00:02:45,078
in this case into the numeric value will
draw a graph

47
00:02:45,078 --> 00:02:49,097
that value overtime I since it was
iterated multiple times in a loop

48
00:02:49,097 --> 00:02:52,101
if you're looking for consul I put like
that from print men

49
00:02:53,037 --> 00:02:57,095
you also find that in the time assistant
their couple other useful things

50
00:02:57,095 --> 00:03:00,134
you I wanna call out here in lower right
hand corner

51
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:04,997
there's a time stepper and this controls
how long your playground will continue

52
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:05,610
to run

53
00:03:05,061 --> 00:03:08,140
after the top %uh sources finished if
you're using my views

54
00:03:09,004 --> 00:03:13,063
or indefinite execution explain what
both those are little later on

55
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:16,460
there's also a slider

56
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:20,170
which allows you to go back in time and
view results in the time line from a

57
00:03:20,017 --> 00:03:22,196
specific point near playground execution

58
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:26,380
so here you can see reviewing a numeric
result from part with you to take an

59
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:27,390
execution

60
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,050
but you for this is very usefull with
live uses it allows you to scrub back

61
00:03:31,005 --> 00:03:34,073
through the recording that view and see
exactly what your animation was doing at

62
00:03:35,018 --> 00:03:36,297
a specific point in time

63
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:39,870
that's what programs are

64
00:03:39,087 --> 00:03:42,095
let's talk a little bit about what you
can use them for we think your first

65
00:03:43,067 --> 00:03:45,075
great use a playground is going to be
learning

66
00:03:45,075 --> 00:03:48,134
we've introduced a brand new language
for you to learn and we think the best

67
00:03:49,034 --> 00:03:49,803
way to get started

68
00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:53,158
is just to open a playground and dive in
and play around

69
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,480
our documentation also includes a
special

70
00:03:57,048 --> 00:04:00,059
interactive program called the swift to
work I

71
00:04:00,059 --> 00:04:03,578
this allows you to see documentation and
playground editor

72
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:07,164
side by side in the same editors so you
can read about how to do something

73
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:12,510
and try it out right there without
leaving the editor friendly

74
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:15,084
we think Tiger are a fantastic way for
people to learn how to program in the

75
00:04:15,084 --> 00:04:15,160
first place

76
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:20,115
beginners don't have to learn how to
configure a project in targeting

77
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:24,570
building run and debug they can just
type code into a player and editor

78
00:04:24,057 --> 00:04:27,466
and immediately see the results if you
know anyone who want to learn how to

79
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:28,600
program

80
00:04:28,006 --> 00:04:32,008
we encourage you to suggest trying in a
playground we picked records are also

81
00:04:32,008 --> 00:04:34,055
going to be an indispensable tool in
your toolbox

82
00:04:35,027 --> 00:04:39,049
for everyday code development if you're
developing an algorithm or any other

83
00:04:39,049 --> 00:04:40,698
separable chekhov code

84
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:44,810
you consider starting at the playground
working and apparently have it how you

85
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:44,140
want it

86
00:04:45,004 --> 00:04:50,008
and then driving that code in your
project for use in your application

87
00:04:50,008 --> 00:04:53,277
any sort of drawing code you want to do
is also great in a playground because

88
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:54,490
you can

89
00:04:54,049 --> 00:04:57,087
immediately see the visual result what
your code is doing

90
00:04:57,087 --> 00:05:00,144
and every time you change your code you
can immediately see how that affects the

91
00:05:01,044 --> 00:05:02,125
visual result

92
00:05:03,025 --> 00:05:06,087
finally processing code like value
transformers or secretive

93
00:05:06,087 --> 00:05:09,124
image filters are great in playgrounds
because you can visualize

94
00:05:10,024 --> 00:05:13,025
the result that every step in the
transformation process

95
00:05:13,025 --> 00:05:16,081
when you change something you can see
how that change ripples through all your

96
00:05:16,081 --> 00:05:17,144
results

97
00:05:18,044 --> 00:05:22,053
we think you'll find a playgrounds are
fertile ground for experimentation

98
00:05:22,053 --> 00:05:25,842
and in particular anytime you trying to
learn some new API

99
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:29,530
you should try to turn a program because
you can immediately see how it works and

100
00:05:29,053 --> 00:05:30,061
what result gives you

101
00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:34,044
you don't need a project you don't need
to build and run

102
00:05:34,044 --> 00:05:37,077
you just open up even a standalone
program document

103
00:05:37,077 --> 00:05:41,696
type in your code and see what happens
I'm sure already have many a time

104
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:45,900
going to create a new project from the
application template

105
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:48,082
not define application did finish
watching just a borderline echoed in two

106
00:05:49,063 --> 00:05:50,097
tries in API

107
00:05:50,097 --> 00:05:53,131
when you probably have to in a small get
to see you can see what happened

108
00:05:54,031 --> 00:05:57,540
you don't have to do that anymore now
you can just open up a playground

109
00:05:57,819 --> 00:06:00,860
and try it papi you wanna try effect

110
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:04,370
we recommend you consider keeping a
playground in your dock at all times for

111
00:06:04,037 --> 00:06:04,130
quick access

112
00:06:05,003 --> 00:06:09,212
to any can you try something it's right
there your fingertips

113
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:13,500
so with all that said let's dive in and
take a look at national program

114
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:16,096
to do that I'm going to invite my
colleague Qatar Open Stage

115
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:20,610
thank you Rick hello everyone my name is
Connor I'm an engineer

116
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:23,991
on the Xcode team in today I'll be
talking to you about how you can work

117
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:25,220
with playgrounds

118
00:06:25,022 --> 00:06:29,065
as well some other things which we think
programs would be really great for

119
00:06:29,065 --> 00:06:32,644
now trick is already covered many of the
basic concepts behind playgrounds

120
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:35,238
and so I think really the best way to
show you how to work with playgrounds

121
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,250
actually just by jumping straight into a
demo

122
00:06:38,025 --> 00:06:41,071
to let's go ahead and do that so here I
am at the diminishing

123
00:06:41,071 --> 00:06:46,000
and I'm just going to go ahead and
launch Xcode

124
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,657
you notice here on the Welcome window
for Xcode

125
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:53,620
we've added this brand new get started
with a playground but it's that way we

126
00:06:53,062 --> 00:06:55,149
want to make it really easy for you just
get started with one

127
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:59,115
please click on that okay to play ground
and I just given a name

128
00:07:00,015 --> 00:07:03,046
and a place to save it so my playground
is fine and click on the desktop is fine

129
00:07:03,046 --> 00:07:04,005
as well

130
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:08,930
so they create and then we have here our
playground itself

131
00:07:08,093 --> 00:07:11,096
you know if that were importing Co Co so
we have full access to be

132
00:07:11,096 --> 00:07:15,305
Coco API's and then we're also creating
a string

133
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:19,990
and we're signing the value hello
playground to that string

134
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:22,588
illness that I in the result sidebar

135
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:26,501
we're seeing the result about so in this
case where seeing the string hello

136
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:27,774
playground

137
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:32,500
okay so best to come to the basic idea
let's try something with numbers

138
00:07:32,005 --> 00:07:35,102
so say 4i and 0-10

139
00:07:36,047 --> 00:07:39,071
say I times I see their

140
00:07:39,071 --> 00:07:42,124
that we execute the code and we're
getting an indicator in the result

141
00:07:43,024 --> 00:07:43,105
sidebar

142
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:49,044
we've executed echoed ten times okay
I'll try putting that up to 100

143
00:07:49,044 --> 00:07:52,052
let it run and will see there that we
immediately get an indication that this

144
00:07:52,052 --> 00:07:54,125
code is executed 100 times

145
00:07:55,025 --> 00:07:58,083
now nine that is very useful information
but sometimes actually wanna see the

146
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:58,482
value

147
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:02,800
there and we have support for that as
well it's okay I'll just

148
00:08:02,008 --> 00:08:05,024
hover over this results you'll see that
we're highlighting line of code with

149
00:08:05,096 --> 00:08:05,150
which its

150
00:08:06,005 --> 00:08:09,086
with which it is associated and were
also showing this button here

151
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:13,106
that's called the value history button
and I go ahead and click on it

152
00:08:14,006 --> 00:08:17,205
will open up the assistant editor into
the time line mode

153
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:20,340
this is the place where you can see
results over time as well the place for

154
00:08:20,034 --> 00:08:23,065
you to store results would you like to
see persistently

155
00:08:23,065 --> 00:08:26,084
as in this case we're showing the graph
for I times I

156
00:08:26,084 --> 00:08:29,086
we've seen as you know that night a
curfew

157
00:08:29,086 --> 00:08:32,159
so K so that's how the basics abusing at
the time line

158
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:36,137
and killing numbers at the trust me a
little bit more interesting

159
00:08:37,037 --> 00:08:40,041
out let's go ahead and do you I
something with apt-get assets

160
00:08:40,077 --> 00:08:43,084
first start by cutting a color say black
color equals

161
00:08:44,047 --> 00:08:47,122
and its color da blue color

162
00:08:48,022 --> 00:08:51,024
you see there that we're now showing in
the result sidebar a color swatch

163
00:08:51,042 --> 00:08:54,124
indicating what the color is as well as
indicators and all the components which

164
00:08:55,024 --> 00:08:57,303
make up at color

165
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,860
as I can you pick the color and its
credit should be string using it

166
00:09:00,086 --> 00:09:03,107
so say lent achieve its training equals
in S

167
00:09:04,007 --> 00:09:07,091
attributed string it will pass it and
the

168
00:09:07,091 --> 00:09:11,116
string and attributes: dictionary to
leave the street we already have

169
00:09:12,016 --> 00:09:16,023
and will create a dictionary CL CNS

170
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:19,097
foreground color actually name help
after the color we have

171
00:09:19,097 --> 00:09:22,131
and they all say INS font attribute name

172
00:09:23,031 --> 00:09:26,110
others pass the parts of saying this
font stamp on its size and

173
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:31,034
go something fairly big so I just put in
42 to about looks like

174
00:09:31,043 --> 00:09:34,322
okay so here you notice that we're
getting a result for this as well

175
00:09:34,709 --> 00:09:37,510
his team that we're showing the plain
text representation this as well as an

176
00:09:37,051 --> 00:09:38,087
icon indicating

177
00:09:38,087 --> 00:09:41,092
that it is and attributed string

178
00:09:41,092 --> 00:09:44,097
now that's great you know we know this
girl is executed but I really wanna see

179
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,094
what the actual value is there see

180
00:09:46,094 --> 00:09:49,142
how the attributed string look for
itself I am disappointed as well

181
00:09:50,042 --> 00:09:54,063
so I can just hover over the results and
in addition to the value history button

182
00:09:54,063 --> 00:09:58,066
you'll see that we have a quick look but
and so if I go ahead and click on that

183
00:09:58,066 --> 00:10:02,092
will show a quick look about value as to
show you the full representation ovett

184
00:10:02,092 --> 00:10:05,111
ad was created in the playground source

185
00:10:06,011 --> 00:10:09,076
so Kate that colors and strings at let's
try something with images

186
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:12,113
attack was set up by creating an array
of his name's sauce a

187
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:16,712
but image names equals will put an array
there and

188
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:19,898
and out something to do you think in
this image name user or accounts or

189
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,490
something in that line so I was gonna
create an

190
00:10:22,049 --> 00:10:25,078
array with image names I think you could
be

191
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,557
image image name user

192
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:33,980
aim user accounts image name user

193
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:38,610
group and Tecate beer in the code any
notice that we now have

194
00:10:38,061 --> 00:10:41,085
an array of strings action wanna see an
array

195
00:10:41,085 --> 00:10:44,134
images and that's very easy to you going
to say something like

196
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:47,948
but images equals image names that map

197
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:52,760
a passive trailing closer to just say
image named

198
00:10:52,076 --> 00:10:55,094
acid at the positional argument dollars
and zero

199
00:10:55,094 --> 00:10:58,169
in an affair that we're now seeing that
the final code executed four times

200
00:10:59,069 --> 00:11:02,075
and so basically we can see that you
have okay that makes sense where

201
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:06,067
exceeding the final cut three times for
the challenge closure itself

202
00:11:06,067 --> 00:11:09,094
they're executing at once for the
assignment two images

203
00:11:09,094 --> 00:11:12,553
actually only wanna see the images array
itself and we have a nice double check

204
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:14,980
for doing that in a playground

205
00:11:14,098 --> 00:11:18,327
you just go ahead and put the thing that
you wanna see on a line by itself

206
00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:23,170
so there you see it with the image is
there we run the code and we're seeing

207
00:11:23,017 --> 00:11:26,076
the images array I can put that and I
can see

208
00:11:26,076 --> 00:11:29,079
ok you know here's the image i'm looking
for. and so

209
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:32,188
I just get that image Philip image

210
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:38,240
equals images 0 will be runnin output
look to make sure it's okay and

211
00:11:38,024 --> 00:11:43,123
in fact get 1 I'm looking for let's go
ahead and put this into an ImageView

212
00:11:43,339 --> 00:11:48,680
so say but ImageView equal INS ImageView

213
00:11:48,068 --> 00:11:51,073
will pass ourself a frame so saying it's
pract

214
00:11:52,018 --> 00:11:55,927
I will say year for the origin because
it really care about that

215
00:11:56,089 --> 00:11:59,188
they also say 512 by 512 for the size

216
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,120
now I'm gonna go ahead and put this
image view on it so might as well

217
00:12:03,012 --> 00:12:06,100
I can put show this result in the time
line

218
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,022
this is a neat little way a building
something up you take the

219
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:13,038
the use are creating the object and then
you put the

220
00:12:13,038 --> 00:12:16,063
own other line where we show it as a
result and working after could in

221
00:12:16,063 --> 00:12:18,892
between there to see how it builds up
over time

222
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:21,546
so we see here that we're starting out
with empty ImageView you know we're not

223
00:12:22,329 --> 00:12:23,490
seeing anything interesting there

224
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:26,085
so at let's go ahead and add our image
the image view

225
00:12:26,085 --> 00:12:30,117
something in his view that image equals
image

226
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:34,088
react if you you'll see here now that
we're in fact showing the image there

227
00:12:34,088 --> 00:12:35,166
but it's not feeling the full image view

228
00:12:36,066 --> 00:12:39,098
it's not doing what we expect and
because we haven't sent a PM skelly

229
00:12:39,098 --> 00:12:40,104
appropriately

230
00:12:41,004 --> 00:12:45,026
SoCal set that as well

231
00:12:45,026 --> 00:12:48,069
say image scaling equals image scale

232
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:51,168
proportionally up or down

233
00:12:52,068 --> 00:12:55,124
react with you and now you see that
we're seeing the image at full size

234
00:12:56,024 --> 00:12:59,563
in the ImageView we've seen what we
expect its okay

235
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:04,290
taken work with system resources country
have many resources at your own d like

236
00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:05,072
to use and playgrounds as well

237
00:13:05,072 --> 00:13:08,081
and we support that too there is going
to go ahead and I'm going to show

238
00:13:09,062 --> 00:13:13,116
the final inspector of item on the right
hand of my

239
00:13:14,016 --> 00:13:17,079
playground you notice here that we're
seeing we have this new section called

240
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:19,091
playground settings which is shown every
year

241
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:22,174
viewing a plague on document you can
select the platform against which the

242
00:13:23,074 --> 00:13:24,080
plague on should execute

243
00:13:24,008 --> 00:13:28,013
and you know I was 10 is what we're
doing right now but we also support i OS

244
00:13:29,003 --> 00:13:33,034
any conflict a path for resources is the
faults to none but you can select one

245
00:13:33,061 --> 00:13:36,910
if you have resources that you're
interested in escaped I was going to say

246
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:41,190
I have a folder resources on my desktop
to dismiss a

247
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:46,528
I'll it is the absolute path option can
go ahead and choose that

248
00:13:46,699 --> 00:13:49,743
say here's my resources folder shoes
that

249
00:13:50,139 --> 00:13:53,610
and then want to make that choice I'm
actually go ahead at hyde

250
00:13:53,061 --> 00:13:56,138
the utilities area

251
00:13:57,038 --> 00:14:00,047
and to access the images themselves I
just use you know

252
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:03,360
in this bundle API you know the
resources shoppers resources for the

253
00:14:03,036 --> 00:14:03,122
main bundle

254
00:14:04,022 --> 00:14:07,141
I can see something like that my image
equals in a

255
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:11,370
image named I have an image in here
that's just called Xcode so

256
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:15,560
let's grab at will be executes

257
00:14:15,056 --> 00:14:18,075
and understand when now we're getting
the Image result here

258
00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:21,940
a quick look to confirm that it's what
I'm thinking in San in fact is we're

259
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:22,193
seeing px but I come there

260
00:14:23,093 --> 00:14:26,192
and not going to happen ImageView show
The X but I can't step

261
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:30,170
sauce a image view Dan image equals

262
00:14:30,017 --> 00:14:33,069
my image well we execute

263
00:14:33,069 --> 00:14:36,898
and I think this new result let's add it
to the time line as well

264
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,180
you can see here that we have what we
expected the exit icon is showing up in

265
00:14:41,018 --> 00:14:42,094
our Image you

266
00:14:42,094 --> 00:14:45,803
try also notice that we're still seeing
the older version here with the

267
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:50,930
user icon in the ImageView and that's
because playground actually capture

268
00:14:50,093 --> 00:14:52,992
results on every single line if
execution she can't so you can do these

269
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:55,310
kinds of comparisons

270
00:14:55,031 --> 00:14:59,042
like in France city no but they could be
an issue we first created and it's empty

271
00:14:59,042 --> 00:15:02,138
then I added the user icon to their and
so we see that earlier version that

272
00:15:03,038 --> 00:15:03,135
without words

273
00:15:04,035 --> 00:15:08,084
small in the center the next to the
image scaling appropriately

274
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,540
and now filling full image you finally I
updated its use my image and we're

275
00:15:12,054 --> 00:15:14,067
seeing that it's showing px Kodak

276
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:16,143
that's great so that you don't have to
you know go back and see what happened

277
00:15:17,043 --> 00:15:21,050
at a particular point we're catching the
data for you as a player executes

278
00:15:22,013 --> 00:15:25,016
I think that about covers the basics so
let's go back to slides and

279
00:15:25,016 --> 00:15:28,695
talk a little bit more about playgrounds
one of the key ideas that you saw there

280
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:31,440
is that playgrounds will automatically
execute

281
00:15:31,044 --> 00:15:35,122
he just type in some code you'll see the
result in the sidebar on the right

282
00:15:36,022 --> 00:15:39,069
additionally you saw that we can at a
value history to the time

283
00:15:39,069 --> 00:15:42,088
so here we have a live coal which
executed 100 times

284
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:45,753
I hover over that result to see this
value history back

285
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:48,940
I click it was switching to the
assistant editor and will show that as a

286
00:15:48,094 --> 00:15:50,933
history of that value

287
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:54,822
additionally many values in the
playground have QuickBooks ice on this

288
00:15:55,209 --> 00:15:56,920
case we have been attributed string

289
00:15:56,092 --> 00:16:00,121
we don't see the full representation in
the sidebar just had the plaintext a bit

290
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:03,961
the pic click on the quick look button
will see the attributed string as it was

291
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:07,083
created in the playground source

292
00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:09,214
we support many different types for
quick look in the playground with

293
00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:10,490
support

294
00:16:10,049 --> 00:16:14,135
colors strings both plain text and
attributed

295
00:16:15,035 --> 00:16:20,056
we can show images use in this case will
capture a snapshot of the

296
00:16:20,056 --> 00:16:24,075
at that point I'm we can show a raise in
dictionaries

297
00:16:24,579 --> 00:16:28,180
as also a structured version at the rare
dictionary I like you might see in the

298
00:16:28,018 --> 00:16:30,537
variables the on the bugger

299
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:33,704
we can show points exercises how to
create a graphical representation of

300
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:35,262
those

301
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:38,836
because you're busy iPads so both
inexpensive path on the Mac

302
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:41,918
and you like to see a path on I last

303
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:45,610
you can show your else for this will
take the plaintext BRL

304
00:16:45,061 --> 00:16:48,063
showed in the sidebar but a few quick
look it will show you a WebView with the

305
00:16:48,063 --> 00:16:50,572
content that the URL

306
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:54,550
and finally for texas we don't have any
too quickly representation

307
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:58,113
we can usually get a structured be a bit
again the cutesy and the variables you

308
00:16:59,013 --> 00:17:03,035
in the debugger so here I have an an
object other class that I created in the

309
00:17:03,035 --> 00:17:03,131
playground

310
00:17:04,031 --> 00:17:08,052
and it is it has a couple properties if
you property and a bar property

311
00:17:08,052 --> 00:17:12,087
using the values that those at that line
of code when executed

312
00:17:12,087 --> 00:17:15,152
in this demo I also show you how you can
use your own resources with playgrounds

313
00:17:16,052 --> 00:17:21,063
in this is actually fairly easy the just
go ahead and show the final inspector

314
00:17:21,063 --> 00:17:24,111
you select a location for playground
resources and for this we have three

315
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:26,022
options

316
00:17:26,022 --> 00:17:29,034
got in absolute path option which
basically says

317
00:17:29,034 --> 00:17:32,090
okay about this folder resources some on
my computer and I'd like to show it in

318
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:32,041
the

319
00:17:33,022 --> 00:17:37,063
use it with the playground we have a
relative to take on path

320
00:17:37,063 --> 00:17:41,065
option and this is really great if
you're sticking your playground at SCM

321
00:17:41,065 --> 00:17:44,098
because he can say oh you know here's
this playground and here's the spoiler

322
00:17:44,098 --> 00:17:47,126
resources this next to it against the
south and then when you other people

323
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:48,123
check out

324
00:17:49,023 --> 00:17:53,048
your repository Bilawal automatically be
able to use the playground with its

325
00:17:53,048 --> 00:17:54,132
resources

326
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:58,078
finally we support inside playground
option this is great if you're sharing

327
00:17:58,078 --> 00:17:58,135
in ways

328
00:17:59,035 --> 00:18:02,037
other than vs CM because you can just
say I

329
00:18:02,037 --> 00:18:06,039
you on so my resources in my playground
email that out to other people

330
00:18:06,057 --> 00:18:09,073
and see at when they open it will be
able to see those resources

331
00:18:09,073 --> 00:18:12,074
immediately

332
00:18:12,074 --> 00:18:15,147
want to have made the selection to
access these resources in your

333
00:18:16,047 --> 00:18:17,059
playground source

334
00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:20,071
just use things like in its final path
resource a type

335
00:18:20,071 --> 00:18:24,071
an innocent named the resources just
show up as be resources for the main

336
00:18:24,071 --> 00:18:24,144
bundle

337
00:18:25,044 --> 00:18:29,079
during program execution

338
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:32,126
so now that we have the basics out of
the way I think I'd like to start

339
00:18:33,026 --> 00:18:34,098
talking to you about some the use cases

340
00:18:34,098 --> 00:18:39,120
for which bygones be really great and
the first abuses experimentation

341
00:18:40,002 --> 00:18:42,076
I'm sure that all the out there have a
folder on your computer which looks

342
00:18:42,094 --> 00:18:43,125
something like this is just

343
00:18:44,025 --> 00:18:47,047
a buncha next good projects created from
the template that

344
00:18:47,047 --> 00:18:51,144
REM maybe one or two changes to see how
something works or to test out an idea

345
00:18:52,044 --> 00:18:55,069
it's actually isn't that easy for
process you have to do many different

346
00:18:55,069 --> 00:18:58,164
first choose the right project template
then find the right file in that

347
00:18:59,064 --> 00:19:03,109
project at which maybe if you're maybe
not depending on which simply chose

348
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:08,078
nephew what you're trying to do in the
first place and that's right thing coat

349
00:19:08,078 --> 00:19:11,143
what you've written something you have
to build your project

350
00:19:12,043 --> 00:19:16,047
in run but every bill and for I watched
the me involved point2 simulator to a

351
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,148
device

352
00:19:18,048 --> 00:19:21,081
and if you didn't get it right the first
time you don't have to redo this stop in

353
00:19:21,081 --> 00:19:24,127
the debugger and scepter your coat
figure out where things are going wrong

354
00:19:25,027 --> 00:19:28,033
we think playgrounds can handle this a
whole lot better

355
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:31,080
it's because there's really only two
steps you just say get started with the

356
00:19:31,008 --> 00:19:31,079
playground

357
00:19:32,051 --> 00:19:35,096
and write your code once you start
writing your code

358
00:19:35,096 --> 00:19:38,109
will automatically executed for you and
show you the result in the sidebar

359
00:19:39,009 --> 00:19:42,016
so you can see where things are going
wrong

360
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:45,094
now I think a pic to show you a demo but
this looks like so let's go back to the

361
00:19:45,094 --> 00:19:45,160
demolition

362
00:19:46,006 --> 00:19:50,009
so here I am I'm going to go ahead and
just want tax code again

363
00:19:50,009 --> 00:19:53,010
and the summer going to create an Iowa
State's playground sauce a

364
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,095
file new file

365
00:19:57,095 --> 00:20:00,152
and all say ISL s playground and

366
00:20:01,052 --> 00:20:04,146
I one actually test out how the UI table
view cell File API works

367
00:20:05,046 --> 00:20:08,067
as I was gonna called the K this
playground and call it test

368
00:20:08,067 --> 00:20:12,104
table you cell save it to the desktop

369
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:17,042
and okay so here we have RI with
playground its importing you like it

370
00:20:17,042 --> 00:20:21,108
I'll but otherwise the same way to
screen a string saying it to a variable

371
00:20:22,008 --> 00:20:26,096
so if I want to use you a table view
cell style any day you a table view cell

372
00:20:26,096 --> 00:20:29,129
and best way to show that is with the UI
table you

373
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:33,057
in order to get the cells into you a
table view any data source

374
00:20:33,057 --> 00:20:36,131
at some let's just go ahead and
implement a datasource so say

375
00:20:37,031 --> 00:20:41,033
class datasource will hear from in this
object

376
00:20:41,051 --> 00:20:47,089
or conform to the UI tableview
datasource protocol

377
00:20:47,089 --> 00:20:50,121
nice now that we're getting an issue
here and that's because the datasource

378
00:20:51,021 --> 00:20:53,050
we've created is actually conform to
your table

379
00:20:53,005 --> 00:20:57,072
datasource and the impact expected we
have actually implementing methods yet

380
00:20:58,017 --> 00:21:02,052
so I'm actually going to jumped to
declaration you a table view data source

381
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:05,141
by Command Option clicking on it you see
that we've been open the assistant

382
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:06,118
editor

383
00:21:07,018 --> 00:21:10,059
and instead of showing you you a table
view that H we're going to show you a

384
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:11,105
swift version

385
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:15,042
I'll thats header in this case we're
seeing

386
00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:19,043
here's our protocol we're seeing that we
need to implement these two methods

387
00:21:19,043 --> 00:21:22,109
and so okay I was going to take this one
this first one to you

388
00:21:23,009 --> 00:21:26,030
atop a table view the number of rows per
section

389
00:21:26,003 --> 00:21:30,011
I'm gonna copy and paste it in here
understand it to sort things out

390
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:33,057
return 1 from this okay

391
00:21:33,057 --> 00:21:38,120
that number rose I let's also by the
south

392
00:21:39,002 --> 00:21:43,055
and okay let's just go ahead and create
are you a table view cell say let's sell

393
00:21:43,073 --> 00:21:46,165
equals I table you sell

394
00:21:47,065 --> 00:21:50,086
need to pick typo here

395
00:21:50,086 --> 00:21:54,115
will say style what to say that font
style

396
00:21:55,015 --> 00:21:58,022
and then for the you say then fire we
are actually going to be reusing the

397
00:21:58,085 --> 00:21:58,127
cells

398
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:02,115
so we can just pass no for this
parameter okay

399
00:22:03,015 --> 00:22:06,081
so that we have our cell let's go ahead
and configure so I can say something

400
00:22:06,081 --> 00:22:07,158
like sell that text label

401
00:22:08,058 --> 00:22:12,105
that text equals text

402
00:22:13,005 --> 00:22:16,091
okay so that's the text label will see
what that looks like UT will you sell

403
00:22:16,091 --> 00:22:18,107
may also have a detailed text label

404
00:22:19,007 --> 00:22:22,052
that's not guaranteed to be the case
going explicitly handle the fact that

405
00:22:22,052 --> 00:22:23,146
it's an optional I can say something
like

406
00:22:24,046 --> 00:22:27,145
if flat detailed text able equals

407
00:22:28,045 --> 00:22:31,045
sell that detailed text label

408
00:22:31,045 --> 00:22:34,076
and so if this at the code inside this
if executes

409
00:22:34,076 --> 00:22:37,133
they will know that we have a detailed
text label second say something like

410
00:22:38,033 --> 00:22:41,075
detailed text label texts

411
00:22:41,075 --> 00:22:45,100
equals detailed text and we know this is
safe we're not going to axe

412
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,027
accidentally tried to sign a property
now that we configure your table view

413
00:22:50,027 --> 00:22:50,074
cell

414
00:22:50,074 --> 00:22:53,169
I can't go ahead return that you can see
now that we

415
00:22:54,069 --> 00:22:57,076
no longer have an issue in our
playground I'll go up not getting any

416
00:22:58,039 --> 00:23:01,045
result in the sidebar that because we
have actually instantiated art

417
00:23:01,045 --> 00:23:04,119
are datasource so others say something
like a datasource

418
00:23:05,019 --> 00:23:08,081
equals datasource and the neck and you
know

419
00:23:08,081 --> 00:23:11,114
Asgard tableview and helped you start
datasource

420
00:23:12,014 --> 00:23:17,049
so that table view equals I tableview

421
00:23:17,049 --> 00:23:20,094
will pass it frame so CG racked

422
00:23:20,094 --> 00:23:24,187
again we don't care about the origin
I'll pass 320 for the width and for the

423
00:23:25,087 --> 00:23:26,143
height we just need enough to be able to

424
00:23:27,043 --> 00:23:31,054
show the all the cells we care about
such a system like 240

425
00:23:31,054 --> 00:23:35,060
family will pass if I love playing until
the table view

426
00:23:35,006 --> 00:23:38,075
to use our data source

427
00:23:39,029 --> 00:23:43,081
and then we will tell the table view to
reload data

428
00:23:43,081 --> 00:23:46,083
what that plague on execute and one
spandex

429
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:49,182
finished executing I will be able to see
be at a table we

430
00:23:50,082 --> 00:23:54,097
we created so I'm gonna just go ahead
and the the time I'm we can see here

431
00:23:54,097 --> 00:23:57,102
we've created a table view we're seeing
the south we want with the tax that we

432
00:23:58,047 --> 00:23:59,085
want

433
00:23:59,085 --> 00:24:02,102
okay so that you know get it up and
running but actually want to see

434
00:24:03,002 --> 00:24:06,007
be styles for all the styles that we
have

435
00:24:06,007 --> 00:24:10,101
I so I went to jump back to the
declaration a guy table view cell style

436
00:24:11,001 --> 00:24:15,002
and see here there are four options sign
going to change this one to a4

437
00:24:15,011 --> 00:24:18,078
so we're four rows and some always
passing the default style I'm going to

438
00:24:18,078 --> 00:24:20,103
criticize it based on the road that
we're currently

439
00:24:21,003 --> 00:24:24,008
at sol se let row equals

440
00:24:24,008 --> 00:24:27,073
and XPath row nothing like

441
00:24:27,073 --> 00:24:31,148
let's I'll equals you a table you self
style

442
00:24:32,048 --> 00:24:36,136
that from rock well past the row this
from Rob will convert

443
00:24:37,036 --> 00:24:40,088
the the UI tape the Rob Rowe integer

444
00:24:40,088 --> 00:24:43,185
into you a table view cell style
optional we can confirm that basically

445
00:24:44,085 --> 00:24:44,134
help

446
00:24:45,034 --> 00:24:48,106
and we can see that oh yes in fact the
style is an optional you a table view

447
00:24:49,006 --> 00:24:50,032
cell style

448
00:24:50,032 --> 00:24:53,065
we were past this directly here we were
getting in air

449
00:24:53,065 --> 00:24:56,087
you can see here we net we need to
experts we

450
00:24:56,087 --> 00:24:59,112
handled the fact that could be no you
know the US he will you sell

451
00:25:00,012 --> 00:25:04,019
initializer doesn't expect that thoughts
go ahead and

452
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:07,027
check that's will say if we have a style
what's unwrap it

453
00:25:07,099 --> 00:25:10,106
otherwise you just use the default style

454
00:25:11,006 --> 00:25:15,067
it's okay and we've handled that well
the play country execute and thus impact

455
00:25:15,067 --> 00:25:17,094
the time when using the jump are

456
00:25:17,094 --> 00:25:20,123
and wanted to be executed will notice
here that

457
00:25:21,023 --> 00:25:24,106
we're now seeing all the different UI
tableview cell styles

458
00:25:25,006 --> 00:25:28,034
in our table you ansohn I have a play
around with second share with my

459
00:25:28,034 --> 00:25:31,062
coworkers or just keep as a reference
for myself see with each you a table

460
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:32,117
yourself style looks like

461
00:25:33,017 --> 00:25:36,105
I let's go back to sites now so that
should you how great playgrounds are for

462
00:25:37,005 --> 00:25:37,097
experimentation

463
00:25:37,097 --> 00:25:41,133
you just it started with an idea write
some code in see how it works

464
00:25:42,033 --> 00:25:45,080
announcement by Rick back on stage to
talk about another great idea we have

465
00:25:45,008 --> 00:25:46,014
for playgrounds and thats

466
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:49,170
algorithm development wreck

467
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:53,010
ex-governor developing algorithms

468
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,072
any other several pieces occurred in a
playground is a great way to go

469
00:25:57,072 --> 00:26:00,149
if you're sure you that I'm gonna dive
right into a demo so we're gonna do

470
00:26:01,049 --> 00:26:01,100
today

471
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,095
is implant insertion sort fairly
straightforward sort we're gonna create

472
00:26:05,095 --> 00:26:06,179
a brand new playground to do that

473
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:10,085
so I just say get started with a program
mccall playground

474
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:15,095
insertion sort and save it on the
desktop

475
00:26:15,095 --> 00:26:18,132
if you don't play with insertion sort
imagine that you have a handcart

476
00:26:19,032 --> 00:26:22,088
you were put in an order with the lowest
price on the left and the highest praise

477
00:26:22,088 --> 00:26:23,093
on the right

478
00:26:23,093 --> 00:26:26,125
when we might do that is start with the
second to last post card

479
00:26:27,025 --> 00:26:31,086
and compare try reference card if it's
max it swapped the position it to cards

480
00:26:31,086 --> 00:26:32,108
in your hand

481
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:36,010
you can look at the third to last post
card and compared to the second to last

482
00:26:36,001 --> 00:26:36,057
most

483
00:26:36,066 --> 00:26:39,081
if thats swap it compared to rappers
cart

484
00:26:39,081 --> 00:26:43,093
swap if needed and going are doing this
for every card in your hand

485
00:26:43,093 --> 00:26:46,130
into every card reach the correct or
position when you're done

486
00:26:47,003 --> 00:26:50,006
your hand will be in order so I let's

487
00:26:50,033 --> 00:26:53,092
let's implement that a playground to
start with we need some random data that

488
00:26:53,092 --> 00:26:53,175
we're gonna sort

489
00:26:54,075 --> 00:26:57,160
so I mean go ahead and I mean it
prepared a rave data

490
00:26:58,006 --> 00:27:02,039
I will use bar because this needs to be
mutable array so I can add to it in sort

491
00:27:02,093 --> 00:27:02,187
it

492
00:27:03,087 --> 00:27:07,160
it will just make an interior in Star
Trek and I can say for I

493
00:27:08,006 --> 00:27:11,052
in 00:03:20 maybe 120 data points

494
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:15,049
if it got out of hand to add a new
element and that use the

495
00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:19,063
arc for random function to generate a
random number

496
00:27:19,063 --> 00:27:22,134
that is returning swift it so we're
gonna cash it explicitly to a swift and

497
00:27:23,034 --> 00:27:27,076
modular set by 100 to get a number
between 0 and 99

498
00:27:27,076 --> 00:27:31,133
so far look at data here you can see I
have a result you're on the right

499
00:27:32,033 --> 00:27:35,080
I here's an array have what looks like
pretty random numbers

500
00:27:35,008 --> 00:27:38,067
you're finished by at the precursors
again reruns and I get a different a

501
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,110
rare brain remembers

502
00:27:41,001 --> 00:27:46,044
okay so that's great I well effective
generated data but

503
00:27:46,053 --> 00:27:48,148
are probably wanted to change in me
every time it to pay current source I

504
00:27:49,048 --> 00:27:51,071
make it hard to develop biographer so

505
00:27:51,071 --> 00:27:54,152
let's grab this rain and data and use it
every time

506
00:27:55,052 --> 00:27:58,133
to do that i mean a quick over the
result sidebar and use command a

507
00:27:59,033 --> 00:28:03,049
to select this data command see to copy
it

508
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:06,136
and I'm just going to pace the same here
as an array literal an actor work of the

509
00:28:07,036 --> 00:28:08,048
same random data

510
00:28:08,048 --> 00:28:12,061
every time okay selector implementing
our algorithm

511
00:28:12,061 --> 00:28:15,124
the first thing we need is a function
tests what you pointed at a

512
00:28:16,024 --> 00:28:19,078
in RA there actually is a built-in
function called swap for this already

513
00:28:19,078 --> 00:28:20,083
but for the sake of argument well

514
00:28:21,028 --> 00:28:25,049
implemented herself seventy fun a coal
mine exchange

515
00:28:25,049 --> 00:28:28,095
I you know we're gonna make this a
generic because

516
00:28:28,095 --> 00:28:31,143
well we have an array of its are
insurgents or should be able to work on

517
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,062
any type

518
00:28:33,062 --> 00:28:37,091
on so any type at least as long as its
compare about one element

519
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:40,180
can be compared as greater than or less
than another so we're mostly work on

520
00:28:41,008 --> 00:28:42,062
compare all types here

521
00:28:43,034 --> 00:28:46,085
exchange function to work on any type
because we swapping tax

522
00:28:46,085 --> 00:28:53,085
so this is an exchanging a tight t and
it's going to take an array ft

523
00:28:53,093 --> 00:28:56,157
and two indexes which we're going to
exchange

524
00:28:57,057 --> 00:29:01,114
in the array so the simplest way to
exchange the object is to assign one to

525
00:29:02,014 --> 00:29:03,023
a temporary variable

526
00:29:03,023 --> 00:29:06,038
its and the second to the first and
assign a temporary variable to the

527
00:29:06,038 --> 00:29:07,075
second so we can say that

528
00:29:07,075 --> 00:29:10,116
10 because Dad II data

529
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:14,041
I equals data J and data

530
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:18,106
J equals 10 okay I think we've
implemented as quickly but

531
00:29:19,006 --> 00:29:24,027
let's try to find out are going to
exchange past my dad I rank

532
00:29:24,027 --> 00:29:28,098
and was a change 0 element with the
second and we'll take a look at our a

533
00:29:28,098 --> 00:29:31,166
when we're done so before own it 0 was
12

534
00:29:32,066 --> 00:29:35,101
in a moment she was 15 now amateurs 15

535
00:29:36,001 --> 00:29:40,052
and I am into his 12 so it looks like
exchange works properly

536
00:29:40,052 --> 00:29:43,078
okay the next thing we need is a
function to given index

537
00:29:43,078 --> 00:29:46,160
look at the data point that index
compare to the data point which left

538
00:29:47,006 --> 00:29:51,028
if last exchange them and keep comparing
in exchanging until it reaches the

539
00:29:51,082 --> 00:29:51,175
correct position

540
00:29:52,075 --> 00:29:58,133
indirect so let's call this function
swap laugh

541
00:29:59,033 --> 00:30:03,041
again it's a chair at this time we need
to actually do comparisons or Saar

542
00:30:03,041 --> 00:30:07,105
haiti is compare a ball ever gonna pass
an array ft

543
00:30:08,005 --> 00:30:13,007
index the that appointment to start
swapping left

544
00:30:13,025 --> 00:30:16,111
okay so let's implement this we're gonna
I start with her indexing go back to

545
00:30:17,011 --> 00:30:18,039
position one

546
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:22,072
not 0k there's nothing to left here to
swap sanity for I

547
00:30:22,072 --> 00:30:25,170
in and you know I could do a range from
12 index

548
00:30:26,007 --> 00:30:29,060
but what I really wanted index to one
term in a reverse the range

549
00:30:30,023 --> 00:30:36,028
with reverse wine three dots makes it a
fully close range which means go all the

550
00:30:36,073 --> 00:30:37,107
way to index

551
00:30:38,007 --> 00:30:42,026
so then reversing this goes from index
in in that one

552
00:30:42,026 --> 00:30:45,026
and free to these our data points I'm
just gonna say if

553
00:30:45,026 --> 00:30:48,073
data have I is less than data I

554
00:30:48,073 --> 00:30:51,086
-1

555
00:30:51,086 --> 00:30:54,109
exchange data

556
00:30:55,009 --> 00:30:58,084
I and II -1 okay if it's not less than

557
00:30:58,084 --> 00:31:02,086
data I -1 imagery the correct order
position in the race so we can stop

558
00:31:03,004 --> 00:31:03,078
there

559
00:31:03,078 --> 00:31:06,086
so it's a else break

560
00:31:06,086 --> 00:31:10,109
okay let's try this function out I am
gonna go ahead and say it's

561
00:31:11,009 --> 00:31:14,100
swap laugh past data and thats

562
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,009
pass on an 1,2,3,4,5 sex respect element
sex

563
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:21,076
left and look at

564
00:31:22,057 --> 00:31:26,089
our data and you can see 0 has moved all
the way from the six position

565
00:31:26,089 --> 00:31:29,091
the beginning here a everything's been
moved to the right

566
00:31:29,091 --> 00:31:32,177
it looks like its functions working
great too okay the last thing we need is

567
00:31:33,077 --> 00:31:33,165
to actually

568
00:31:34,065 --> 00:31:38,069
implement the sort should be pretty
simple well caller function I sort

569
00:31:38,069 --> 00:31:41,110
works again on tape he that is
compatible

570
00:31:42,001 --> 00:31:45,100
and we can just pass array ft answer
correct

571
00:31:46,009 --> 00:31:49,101
you this and is gonna say for I in one
we're starting at one cuz there's

572
00:31:50,001 --> 00:31:50,054
nothing

573
00:31:50,054 --> 00:31:53,063
left here sortie to you

574
00:31:53,063 --> 00:31:56,109
data doc count

575
00:31:57,009 --> 00:32:00,028
swap left

576
00:32:00,028 --> 00:32:03,110
data II so let's try it out

577
00:32:04,001 --> 00:32:08,065
I sort data and we look at her dad I
remembered I'm

578
00:32:08,074 --> 00:32:11,140
you can see it did a whole buncha
retirement appear and now here's our

579
00:32:12,004 --> 00:32:13,043
final array

580
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:16,128
and it looks like this is in sorted
order so we've correctly abroad

581
00:32:17,028 --> 00:32:18,116
insertion sort

582
00:32:19,016 --> 00:32:22,067
so this is great for simple algorithm I
can search insert that wasn't too hard

583
00:32:22,067 --> 00:32:24,164
but you know if I was doing something
more complicated it might be nice to

584
00:32:25,064 --> 00:32:28,081
have more visibility into exactly what's
going on here

585
00:32:28,081 --> 00:32:31,154
let's look at how we might visualize a
result in more detail

586
00:32:32,054 --> 00:32:37,063
westerner with extra graph the resort's
added at the beginning

587
00:32:37,063 --> 00:32:39,072
do that it's gonna say for action
director iterate through every data

588
00:32:40,053 --> 00:32:40,149
point

589
00:32:41,049 --> 00:32:44,107
edges prayer X it so you see

590
00:32:45,007 --> 00:32:48,038
there twenty get a point here sits right
next year twenty times

591
00:32:48,038 --> 00:32:53,057
a quick on the value history button I
get a nice crack here showing my dad at

592
00:32:53,057 --> 00:32:54,064
the beginning and boy

593
00:32:54,064 --> 00:32:57,133
that does look random okay so

594
00:32:58,033 --> 00:33:01,052
now I I wanna try to print out another
graph

595
00:33:01,052 --> 00:33:05,070
everytime swap left is called so I can
see what's happening to the graft over

596
00:33:05,007 --> 00:33:06,068
iterations have swapped left

597
00:33:07,031 --> 00:33:10,038
and I could put this for statement in
the end it's what left again

598
00:33:11,001 --> 00:33:15,017
ensure that I history but a given value
history term I am forgiven

599
00:33:15,017 --> 00:33:18,035
I line is when show all the data from
that line

600
00:33:18,035 --> 00:33:21,066
so you can swap it it's called if that
would be appended to the same

601
00:33:21,066 --> 00:33:25,091
i graph that's not what I want I want a
new graph every time it's called

602
00:33:25,091 --> 00:33:28,142
to do that we're gonna need a new tool
in our toolbox I'm gonna go back to

603
00:33:29,042 --> 00:33:29,087
stride

604
00:33:29,087 --> 00:33:32,111
show you that with playgrounds
worshiping a new framework called

605
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:36,026
XE playground it contains some very
useful utilities

606
00:33:36,026 --> 00:33:39,103
for enhancing your playgrounds right now
with I have

607
00:33:40,003 --> 00:33:43,082
API for menu recapturing values to
display in time line item

608
00:33:43,082 --> 00:33:48,156
showing your views live extending
execution for a synchronous code

609
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:53,081
right now we're going to use the API for
many capturing value

610
00:33:53,081 --> 00:33:56,099
that API is called XCP capture value

611
00:33:56,099 --> 00:33:59,143
it's a function that takes a ride in a
fire which is a string

612
00:34:00,043 --> 00:34:03,044
and your value which is at any time

613
00:34:03,044 --> 00:34:07,046
when you pass it your value it would
take at value and put it in a time line

614
00:34:07,046 --> 00:34:08,455
item for you

615
00:34:08,869 --> 00:34:12,918
but so the aid in a fire that you pass
it identified what time I am you want

616
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:14,383
that night to go to

617
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:18,625
if you call this function a different
lines but passed the same identifiers

618
00:34:18,859 --> 00:34:21,891
the values from the different lines go
to the same time line item

619
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:26,204
conversely and what we were here if you
have one line because actually be

620
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:27,490
captured value

621
00:34:27,049 --> 00:34:29,988
but it's called multiple times with
different identifiers and it passes

622
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:31,451
those different identifiers

623
00:34:31,649 --> 00:34:34,674
that 19 can generate but whatever time
line items

624
00:34:34,899 --> 00:34:39,270
for grabs in our case that inter-party
talks are shown as the name at the time

625
00:34:39,027 --> 00:34:39,094
line item

626
00:34:39,094 --> 00:34:42,094
you can easily see what data is what

627
00:34:42,094 --> 00:34:45,100
the value passed can be anything it's a
generic but it helps

628
00:34:46,054 --> 00:34:49,055
if it's a type a value that we know had
a quick look appropriately

629
00:34:49,055 --> 00:34:52,152
so let's go back give this a shot to
start out with any

630
00:34:53,052 --> 00:34:58,056
import a key player in to make APR
available

631
00:34:58,092 --> 00:35:01,164
and I'm gonna go ahead and define a new
function

632
00:35:02,064 --> 00:35:05,101
a car visualize and it's a generic and
take

633
00:35:06,001 --> 00:35:10,050
an array of type T and I'm going to use
this for the pin it

634
00:35:10,005 --> 00:35:14,081
so distant that and close the Fortune up
but instead of just putting a tax

635
00:35:15,026 --> 00:35:19,050
what we want to do is capture that I
soco XCP capture value

636
00:35:19,005 --> 00:35:22,012
I need needed a fireside chat when
terror function so

637
00:35:22,057 --> 00:35:25,098
I don't get a fire string

638
00:35:25,098 --> 00:35:28,107
and we can pass it in a fire

639
00:35:29,007 --> 00:35:33,074
an hour value is X okay so let's try
this version now

640
00:35:33,074 --> 00:35:36,076
and visualize the data at the start have
are sort

641
00:35:36,076 --> 00:35:40,098
Emily which star it in a fire just so we
know it's white

642
00:35:40,098 --> 00:35:43,195
and you can see Iran in here's our data
at the start

643
00:35:44,095 --> 00:35:48,160
that's a good start now we're gonna go
ahead and visualize your data after

644
00:35:49,006 --> 00:35:50,010
every iteration

645
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:53,092
swap left second call visualize

646
00:35:53,092 --> 00:35:56,108
a pass data as it is after his
iterations right left

647
00:35:57,008 --> 00:36:01,009
and brighter fire that certainly would
after the iteration

648
00:36:01,009 --> 00:36:05,010
number time it's robert is called which
is the index

649
00:36:05,001 --> 00:36:08,085
parameter at seven let us right now

650
00:36:08,094 --> 00:36:11,096
you can see it's generated multiple
graphs lady

651
00:36:12,014 --> 00:36:16,020
labeled after the iteration that were on
so now we can just scroll through here

652
00:36:16,002 --> 00:36:19,031
and see what's happening to our data
overtime as

653
00:36:19,049 --> 00:36:23,077
swap left runs and the sort completes
you can see it looks record data is

654
00:36:23,077 --> 00:36:23,084
getting started

655
00:36:24,047 --> 00:36:28,140
piece by piece into at the end we have a
nicely sorted array

656
00:36:29,004 --> 00:36:33,060
so there we can easily visualize exactly
what's going on with our algorithm

657
00:36:33,096 --> 00:36:36,194
we think you'll find it's very very
useful

658
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:40,129
okay let's move on to another example
ago he

659
00:36:41,029 --> 00:36:44,036
they can I made here earlier and it's
got this he prefered crash

660
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:47,101
top which explain in a moment but to me
this crash

661
00:36:48,001 --> 00:36:51,040
is my keep grass which I if you're not
familiar with the heap

662
00:36:51,004 --> 00:36:54,015
a heap is a type a balanced binary tree

663
00:36:54,051 --> 00:36:57,129
with the value every node is greater
than or equal to the value of its

664
00:36:58,029 --> 00:37:00,033
children

665
00:37:00,033 --> 00:37:02,039
each are often used to implement
priority queues because it's very

666
00:37:02,093 --> 00:37:05,164
efficient to remove the highest priority
and that's the top of the tree

667
00:37:06,064 --> 00:37:09,083
it's our tradition to insert new aliens
into the correct position in the tree

668
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:11,086
for their priority

669
00:37:11,086 --> 00:37:14,101
wherever amending our heap with an
underlying array

670
00:37:15,001 --> 00:37:18,015
to represent the tree and inner ring the

671
00:37:18,015 --> 00:37:22,020
tree noted index hi has children it
indexes I times to you

672
00:37:22,002 --> 00:37:26,038
and I tends two parts one you can see
that here at the bottom

673
00:37:26,056 --> 00:37:29,154
we've got some random data that we see
ourselves with and we created new heat

674
00:37:30,054 --> 00:37:31,068
with that data

675
00:37:31,068 --> 00:37:35,095
and we he provide the heap which is to
say with that data into correctly heap

676
00:37:35,095 --> 00:37:37,099
sorted order

677
00:37:37,099 --> 00:37:40,163
on the right in the result sidebar you
can see our default

678
00:37:41,063 --> 00:37:44,090
treatment are discussed in class it's
sure the name in the crash

679
00:37:44,009 --> 00:37:48,051
and show its properties in this case it
is one property which is that he parade

680
00:37:49,032 --> 00:37:52,086
and here it is before it's been here a
fight when it's not a correct E

681
00:37:52,086 --> 00:37:55,169
and here it is after its been here for
five minutes reportedly Creek keep

682
00:37:56,069 --> 00:37:59,130
you know it's really hard to tell
looking at this array

683
00:38:00,003 --> 00:38:03,018
whether that's a correct keep this
history represents a tree in

684
00:38:03,045 --> 00:38:06,052
you know that's a good at visualizing
overhears I am here I times to you in

685
00:38:07,015 --> 00:38:11,023
yeah that's less wouldn't be much better
if I could just visualize this

686
00:38:11,023 --> 00:38:15,042
as a tree everywhere my hip is reference
to my pregnant source

687
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:19,065
so let's see how to do that in order to
visualize my own custom back

688
00:38:19,065 --> 00:38:23,161
we're going to implement custom
QuickBooks support for this class

689
00:38:24,061 --> 00:38:27,094
our custom QuickBooks support allows you
to add QuickBooks

690
00:38:27,094 --> 00:38:31,113
for I said prices have in this object on
me right now

691
00:38:32,013 --> 00:38:35,102
and to do it you implement the debug
QuickBooks object method

692
00:38:36,002 --> 00:38:40,045
which takes no parameters and returns
any object is an optional

693
00:38:40,045 --> 00:38:43,131
and you're gonna return the value that
you want to represent your object as its

694
00:38:44,031 --> 00:38:45,075
quick look

695
00:38:45,075 --> 00:38:48,109
on so right now that value

696
00:38:49,009 --> 00:38:52,067
the values that we support here art
colors

697
00:38:52,067 --> 00:38:55,156
strings both pain and attributed images

698
00:38:56,056 --> 00:39:00,117
and busy a Pats for your custom cookbook
you can use any of these tax

699
00:39:01,017 --> 00:39:04,035
so let's try to

700
00:39:04,035 --> 00:39:08,053
okay so I imagine before I head over low
heat graph request that I wrote

701
00:39:08,053 --> 00:39:11,139
that's right across the new data taken
arraigned right is a treat for you that

702
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:16,117
well implement our debug quick look
object method

703
00:39:17,017 --> 00:39:20,019
it takes NERR returns any object

704
00:39:20,019 --> 00:39:24,071
as an optional and we're just gonna
create whatever

705
00:39:24,071 --> 00:39:27,148
he graph first

706
00:39:28,048 --> 00:39:30,124
and the see CREF earners had a
generation in this image which is one of

707
00:39:31,024 --> 00:39:31,058
the

708
00:39:31,058 --> 00:39:34,116
custom quick look tight support tights
so we're just gonna return the images

709
00:39:35,016 --> 00:39:37,038
generated G dark grafite

710
00:39:37,038 --> 00:39:40,069
and past self that he parade

711
00:39:40,069 --> 00:39:43,148
and now when this runs instead of
showing the people representation for a

712
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:44,121
class

713
00:39:45,021 --> 00:39:48,072
it shows our custom quick look
representation which is an image

714
00:39:48,072 --> 00:39:51,077
and so when a quick quick quick button
you can see here

715
00:39:51,077 --> 00:39:55,080
it's drying my keep as a tree this is
before it's been here before I

716
00:39:55,008 --> 00:39:59,095
when you can see for example 78 I is
less than 89 to this is not a gritty

717
00:40:00,067 --> 00:40:03,115
but if I quick look at after its been he
provide

718
00:40:04,015 --> 00:40:08,036
I can now go a great +91 is greater than
86 89

719
00:40:08,036 --> 00:40:11,121
86 is greater than 84 in 79 and so on
and so forth

720
00:40:12,021 --> 00:40:16,053
and I can really easily visually verify
that this is the correct keep

721
00:40:16,053 --> 00:40:19,079
that's how you can quickly your own
prices in playgrounds

722
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:22,147
we think you'll find that very useful
art next we'd like to move on to showing

723
00:40:23,047 --> 00:40:23,085
you

724
00:40:23,085 --> 00:40:26,106
how great it is to develop do custom
view development and other drawing

725
00:40:27,006 --> 00:40:27,079
development

726
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:30,085
in playgrounds and to do that I'm gonna
hand it over to Connor

727
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:35,041
thank you Rick another great a use case
we think playgrounds

728
00:40:35,041 --> 00:40:38,138
I will be used for is custom you
development that's because you can just

729
00:40:39,038 --> 00:40:40,041
start writing some code

730
00:40:40,068 --> 00:40:43,152
and see the actual view as it's being
drawn as you're saying to build up your

731
00:40:44,052 --> 00:40:45,117
drawing code:

732
00:40:46,017 --> 00:40:49,065
syphilis I have a goal I want to take
this play can I come in at some

733
00:40:49,065 --> 00:40:50,120
animation to it

734
00:40:51,002 --> 00:40:54,063
the economy have is really great pygmies
the playfulness the playgrounds

735
00:40:54,081 --> 00:40:57,085
but my playground themselves it's static
there's

736
00:40:58,021 --> 00:41:02,049
nothing dynamic about it and so I'm
going to try to add animation to this

737
00:41:02,049 --> 00:41:05,073
and what better way to do that then when
in a playground itself so

738
00:41:05,073 --> 00:41:09,159
what's improper to the demo so OK out
here and then ok go ahead and open up

739
00:41:10,059 --> 00:41:14,066
a plague on the party started

740
00:41:15,029 --> 00:41:18,063
okay so here we got a playground we've
got our so passive in its view

741
00:41:18,063 --> 00:41:21,084
a player and i cant view as a few the

742
00:41:21,084 --> 00:41:24,125
layers attendees at three instance

743
00:41:25,025 --> 00:41:28,060
rd3 instance methods I was actually the
Center for those layers

744
00:41:28,006 --> 00:41:31,015
you see that their animal minute right
now and we'll come back to that moment

745
00:41:32,005 --> 00:41:35,083
also have an extension I finish color
which defines a couple

746
00:41:36,028 --> 00:41:39,091
love colors for the play and i cum
itself

747
00:41:39,091 --> 00:41:42,097
I didn't have as a helper function to
convert

748
00:41:42,097 --> 00:41:46,179
in in this busy a path to a CG path for
use with caca player

749
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:50,133
family I just go ahead and create an
intense my playground I can view

750
00:41:51,033 --> 00:41:54,033
and then I put on a separate line so I
can add some stuff later

751
00:41:54,033 --> 00:41:58,070
let's go ahead and show that in the time

752
00:41:58,007 --> 00:42:03,083
okay to see now that we've just got
ourselves in Mt view here

753
00:42:04,046 --> 00:42:08,078
see if we have an interview here we
actually just now need to go ahead and

754
00:42:08,078 --> 00:42:08,165
implement these

755
00:42:09,065 --> 00:42:12,070
setup functions I so let's go ahead and
do that

756
00:42:13,015 --> 00:42:19,079
so set up by creating the path for the
background player

757
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:22,128
so you can you see here working in this
busy Pathan we can put look at to make

758
00:42:23,028 --> 00:42:23,106
sure it looks right

759
00:42:24,006 --> 00:42:27,011
M in fact yeah that looks more less like
the playground icon

760
00:42:27,056 --> 00:42:31,130
so tell outside set up earlier

761
00:42:32,003 --> 00:42:35,099
taking our saying at the lair you can
see here in the time line that we're now

762
00:42:36,026 --> 00:42:39,122
dry in the lair where you have the back
and we've got a little border there and

763
00:42:40,022 --> 00:42:40,047
so

764
00:42:40,046 --> 00:42:44,113
okay it got back on set up but also do
the C sub base and will do the same

765
00:42:45,013 --> 00:42:45,055
thing

766
00:42:45,055 --> 00:42:48,138
while create a path for that

767
00:42:49,038 --> 00:42:52,080
and will that execute and we'll see here
let's quick look make sure

768
00:42:52,008 --> 00:42:55,029
yep it looks more less like the little
base that we have for the player for the

769
00:42:56,001 --> 00:43:01,027
see-saw so let's set the layer south as
well

770
00:43:01,027 --> 00:43:03,116
and their we just make that change
immediately get the feedback i've seen

771
00:43:04,016 --> 00:43:04,092
what that looks like

772
00:43:04,092 --> 00:43:08,092
when drawn in our view so did the sea
somewhere

773
00:43:08,092 --> 00:43:12,176
about sankara set that up as well see
here that we just you know have a

774
00:43:13,076 --> 00:43:16,173
closure which will create the child by
itself with an II

775
00:43:17,073 --> 00:43:20,076
create couples layers for the children
on each side have the

776
00:43:20,076 --> 00:43:24,117
see-saw I know is that the bench itself
and then add those layers to our city

777
00:43:25,017 --> 00:43:26,086
somewhere

778
00:43:26,086 --> 00:43:28,168
okay so now we've got ourselves
something that looks kinda like the

779
00:43:29,068 --> 00:43:30,123
playground icon

780
00:43:31,023 --> 00:43:34,090
but like the icon itself it's not
animating so let's go ahead that support

781
00:43:34,009 --> 00:43:36,107
for an emissions are playing on my
country

782
00:43:37,088 --> 00:43:40,090
I wasn't for that as well and so

783
00:43:41,008 --> 00:43:45,057
let's walk through this is doing I find
a constant for the maximum angle and the

784
00:43:45,057 --> 00:43:45,106
see-saw

785
00:43:46,006 --> 00:43:49,013
I'm you know what do this I think I over
twelve is about right

786
00:43:49,076 --> 00:43:52,109
awesome a property for the current hang
on the see-saw after any pending

787
00:43:53,009 --> 00:43:55,023
animations finish

788
00:43:55,023 --> 00:43:59,023
and have a property which determines
whether or not it should be animating

789
00:43:59,023 --> 00:44:02,048
I'd set out as false but we have this
code here which executes where this is

790
00:44:02,048 --> 00:44:02,093
set

791
00:44:02,093 --> 00:44:06,120
say well if the animation state has
changed and we're told to enemy

792
00:44:07,002 --> 00:44:11,081
men just start animating dipping on the
current angle the see-saw

793
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:15,100
and have thus helping method were
actually performing animation itself

794
00:44:16,009 --> 00:44:19,102
there is no go ahead courtesy a basic
animation said a couple values

795
00:44:20,002 --> 00:44:23,083
Center timing function to match but a
sees how it actually looks like

796
00:44:23,083 --> 00:44:27,091
the duration to what was passed in which
defaults to 1/2 seconds

797
00:44:27,091 --> 00:44:31,154
Abbott can be customized depending on
the angle the see-saw

798
00:44:32,054 --> 00:44:36,059
within an animation to RC Sullair we set
the underlying chance for property that

799
00:44:37,004 --> 00:44:39,032
sea salt layer so that what the
animation completes

800
00:44:39,032 --> 00:44:44,055
it looks cracked and then we update our
currency sign your property accordingly

801
00:44:44,055 --> 00:44:47,060
finally we have I we implement the
animation did stop finished

802
00:44:48,005 --> 00:44:51,099
delegate call back basically say that if
we finish and was the first is to be

803
00:44:51,099 --> 00:44:51,187
animating

804
00:44:52,087 --> 00:44:56,120
then just go ahead and me to the OPs in
angola but we currently are at

805
00:44:57,002 --> 00:45:04,002
soaking let's go ahead and some disputes
are in a meeting

806
00:45:05,008 --> 00:45:09,009
so what do that and you'll notice that
after reruns we've seen the view

807
00:45:09,009 --> 00:45:12,080
update its look you know so we see that
it tilted over to the side

808
00:45:12,008 --> 00:45:15,029
we're not in the animation itself if
that we're going to need some help from

809
00:45:16,001 --> 00:45:17,026
the XT playground framework

810
00:45:17,026 --> 00:45:20,027
so but switchback decides to see what I
could look like

811
00:45:20,036 --> 00:45:23,040
the second piece of functionality which
the XT playground framework provides the

812
00:45:23,076 --> 00:45:25,172
ability to show live use and the time

813
00:45:26,072 --> 00:45:30,075
he do that by calling this XTP show View
Function it takes in identifiers

814
00:45:31,002 --> 00:45:34,053
and the view that you wanna show after
calling it will show the view live by

815
00:45:34,053 --> 00:45:35,069
the playground executes

816
00:45:35,069 --> 00:45:38,136
anything over court frames as the pecan
executes see can play them back

817
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:43,053
what execution finishes they defy you
pass a dysfunction

818
00:45:43,053 --> 00:45:46,112
must be unique insight at the playground
because this is how we refer to the live

819
00:45:47,012 --> 00:45:48,089
you internally in Xcode

820
00:45:48,089 --> 00:45:53,091
I and it is also a week show as the
title for the five you in the time

821
00:45:54,009 --> 00:45:57,057
the view past must also not have a
superb you this is because we will add

822
00:45:57,057 --> 00:45:57,121
it to our own

823
00:45:58,021 --> 00:46:02,102
the hierarchy and it would generally not
produce the results you looking for

824
00:46:03,002 --> 00:46:07,041
so with with this in our toolbox let's
jump back to the demo and see how to use

825
00:46:07,041 --> 00:46:13,053
so go ahead and just go ahead and import
XE playground

826
00:46:13,053 --> 00:46:16,080
and then come here incentives having
this view item I'm gonna remove that

827
00:46:16,008 --> 00:46:17,092
from the time line

828
00:46:18,064 --> 00:46:21,072
I say something like XTP show view

829
00:46:22,044 --> 00:46:25,136
pass in identifying it can be anything
as long as its unique sauce a

830
00:46:26,036 --> 00:46:29,078
playground icon you

831
00:46:29,078 --> 00:46:33,136
in the past the view that we created so
we'll just let that we execute

832
00:46:34,036 --> 00:46:38,085
you see there that in the time I'm
showing the view live as its animating

833
00:46:38,085 --> 00:46:41,113
yasser probably noticed at this little
timeout feel down here

834
00:46:42,013 --> 00:46:45,018
and that led to specify the amount of
time which will let the playground

835
00:46:45,063 --> 00:46:45,155
continue executing

836
00:46:46,055 --> 00:46:49,079
after you reach the end execution at the
top of a coat

837
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:52,170
now i'd the faucet 30 seconds but I can
adjust the fountain I know my animation

838
00:46:53,007 --> 00:46:53,094
only takes about

839
00:46:54,057 --> 00:46:58,082
a second half so under 10 seconds to get
a few times around

840
00:46:58,082 --> 00:47:01,096
after we had that will rerun it an and
so

841
00:47:01,096 --> 00:47:04,173
that's great we see it running back and
I like to show you how you can integrate

842
00:47:05,073 --> 00:47:09,134
XTP should be with the XCP capture value
API mentioned earlier

843
00:47:10,034 --> 00:47:14,047
and so what I wanna do then to capture
be angle at the see-saw

844
00:47:14,047 --> 00:47:18,063
ira the left it to the see-saw an

845
00:47:18,063 --> 00:47:21,063
as we're animating so here is conveying
XTP

846
00:47:21,063 --> 00:47:25,072
capture value a pass left see-saw

847
00:47:25,072 --> 00:47:29,109
position else has the role because we
know at this point but it you know

848
00:47:30,009 --> 00:47:34,086
it's flat on there make take this and
I'm going to put it in our animation did

849
00:47:34,086 --> 00:47:36,099
stop finished call back

850
00:47:36,099 --> 00:47:40,143
now in his past the negative currency
tying goal

851
00:47:41,043 --> 00:47:44,092
SS because that's what we need to do in
order to get at the left

852
00:47:44,092 --> 00:47:48,041
position at the see-saw edged having all
works out for the chance for

853
00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:52,100
see he see here that as we're executing
within the graft and a building up over

854
00:47:52,001 --> 00:47:53,020
time

855
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:56,700
and then what execution finishes the
graph snap back into place in cash show

856
00:47:56,007 --> 00:47:56,050
you

857
00:47:57,013 --> 00:48:00,027
their best view of the data collected

858
00:48:00,027 --> 00:48:03,072
suck it you probably also noticed the
slider became active

859
00:48:03,072 --> 00:48:06,127
and I can just go ahead and take that
and dragged through here

860
00:48:07,027 --> 00:48:10,036
and you'll notice that where updating
the graph at the bottom or also showing

861
00:48:10,036 --> 00:48:10,075
you

862
00:48:10,075 --> 00:48:14,158
the animation your adamant there in time
so this is the I fairly basic animation

863
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:18,092
and doing what we expected but yeah if
you had something more complex than you

864
00:48:18,092 --> 00:48:19,129
wanted this kind of take a look at

865
00:48:20,029 --> 00:48:24,035
small portion a beer animation you could
do that as well

866
00:48:24,035 --> 00:48:27,106
ackhouse do something like you know
click on wannabes points secretary see

867
00:48:28,006 --> 00:48:28,043
it

868
00:48:28,043 --> 00:48:31,107
no that the two things are in sync I
could bear that that's the point

869
00:48:32,007 --> 00:48:35,046
he's the heir key is to go through the
graphs points and see that okay yeah you

870
00:48:35,046 --> 00:48:36,118
know we're doing what we expect

871
00:48:37,018 --> 00:48:41,054
it to do and so that's how you can show
wide use in the time line

872
00:48:41,054 --> 00:48:44,086
with the ex the playground framework but
the back to fight now

873
00:48:44,086 --> 00:48:46,092
now I'd like to talk to you about how
you can use a synchronous code in your

874
00:48:47,046 --> 00:48:48,052
playgrounds

875
00:48:48,052 --> 00:48:50,059
it'll taste in this minimum before but
like to go into a little bit more detail

876
00:48:51,022 --> 00:48:52,111
now

877
00:48:53,011 --> 00:48:56,022
the third piece of functionality which
the XT taken framework for brides

878
00:48:56,022 --> 00:48:59,065
is the ability to extend execution

879
00:48:59,065 --> 00:49:02,136
by default execution turn it's what all
top overcoats executed

880
00:49:03,036 --> 00:49:06,131
at the playground ok provides API for
extending execution and definitely

881
00:49:07,031 --> 00:49:11,043
that this XCP said execution should
continue indefinitely function

882
00:49:11,043 --> 00:49:14,066
he's gonna this is actually not quite
indefinite the execution time is

883
00:49:14,066 --> 00:49:16,071
controlled by the timelines timeout

884
00:49:17,016 --> 00:49:20,090
which defaults to thirty seconds
additionally

885
00:49:20,009 --> 00:49:24,023
at execution will be terminated if you
at the playground while it's running

886
00:49:25,004 --> 00:49:28,006
at this is so that we can show you up to
date results rather than let

887
00:49:28,024 --> 00:49:32,076
leaving you with sale results while way
for an earlier execution to finish

888
00:49:32,076 --> 00:49:35,115
additionally at the Sun lasting oh we oh
we can actually call this function but

889
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:36,089
we saw

890
00:49:36,089 --> 00:49:40,123
bad execution continued after we reach
the in a palpable code

891
00:49:41,023 --> 00:49:45,051
that's because XCP shove you implicitly
calls XTP said execution should continue

892
00:49:45,051 --> 00:49:46,080
indefinitely

893
00:49:46,008 --> 00:49:49,084
you think about this as if nothing in
the plague on sources told Xcode that

894
00:49:50,056 --> 00:49:51,127
the plague on Lisa say live

895
00:49:52,027 --> 00:49:56,072
in the playground will stop executing
one seriously in the top

896
00:49:56,072 --> 00:49:58,130
now officially a quick demo but it's
like he's a synchronous code and

897
00:49:59,003 --> 00:50:00,025
playgrounds

898
00:50:00,052 --> 00:50:04,131
he ran back here and I have playground
which uses at a synchronous code

899
00:50:05,031 --> 00:50:08,094
we create AAA we have our session
delegate which is an if you're all

900
00:50:08,094 --> 00:50:09,128
sessions I'll get

901
00:50:10,028 --> 00:50:13,049
has a few call backs I and then we also
just you know

902
00:50:13,049 --> 00:50:16,105
benefits every delegate pitted miss you
are out session

903
00:50:17,005 --> 00:50:20,051
and then created a task to add download
the content

904
00:50:20,051 --> 00:50:24,082
at the Apple homepage with Intel the
data task tourism

905
00:50:24,082 --> 00:50:27,115
and you notice that you know the plan
itself is executed but were not

906
00:50:28,015 --> 00:50:29,060
receiving any results appear

907
00:50:29,006 --> 00:50:32,101
and if I open up the assistant editor

908
00:50:33,055 --> 00:50:35,130
you know is that we have received any
consular output even though they're

909
00:50:36,003 --> 00:50:37,072
clearly longing

910
00:50:37,369 --> 00:50:40,830
here I that we've received some bites

911
00:50:40,083 --> 00:50:43,088
and it's because nothing in the
playground has told the playing on the

912
00:50:43,088 --> 00:50:44,151
to continue executing

913
00:50:45,051 --> 00:50:48,142
I so we at call past that reason we
resume the task and then

914
00:50:49,042 --> 00:50:52,088
estimate that measures we could be in
the top level code: and the plague under

915
00:50:52,088 --> 00:50:53,159
stops executing

916
00:50:54,059 --> 00:50:57,147
let's go ahead and say imports XE
playground

917
00:50:58,047 --> 00:51:03,056
and then could say XP set execution she
continue

918
00:51:03,056 --> 00:51:06,140
except execution should continue
indefinitely either take the ball

919
00:51:07,004 --> 00:51:10,009
that defaults to true see typically
don't need to pass anything there and I

920
00:51:10,045 --> 00:51:11,101
want you back here

921
00:51:12,001 --> 00:51:15,063
now noticed that you know we were seeing
results from here processing the Consul

922
00:51:15,063 --> 00:51:16,092
output we expect

923
00:51:16,092 --> 00:51:19,106
in the time okay at a use

924
00:51:20,006 --> 00:51:23,065
a sickness can play counts let's go back
fights now

925
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:26,800
there are few alternatives but we really
think that you should at typically is

926
00:51:26,008 --> 00:51:29,010
actually peace and execution should
continue indefinitely when you trying to

927
00:51:29,082 --> 00:51:31,111
use a secret code in playgrounds

928
00:51:32,011 --> 00:51:34,107
if that won't work for you though you
can use other methods for waiting for a

929
00:51:35,007 --> 00:51:37,011
synchronous operations to finish

930
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:39,770
basically just need to make sure you
don't reach the end a typable code

931
00:51:39,869 --> 00:51:42,140
before your operation completes

932
00:51:42,014 --> 00:51:44,088
before we leave today I'd like to talk
to you a little bit about from the

933
00:51:44,088 --> 00:51:46,096
limitations we have playgrounds

934
00:51:47,068 --> 00:51:51,080
first of you should not use performance
playgrounds for any performance testing

935
00:51:51,008 --> 00:51:54,017
I that's because the long a result in
the playground will generally dominate

936
00:51:54,089 --> 00:51:54,163
the runtime

937
00:51:55,063 --> 00:51:58,155
I'm not your actual code this means that
the performance will be dependent on the

938
00:51:59,055 --> 00:52:00,150
number of lines of code executed

939
00:52:01,005 --> 00:52:04,008
that the actual performance whatever it
is you're developing

940
00:52:04,053 --> 00:52:07,082
and that's not necessarily what you'd
expect

941
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:11,085
he said we'd suggest that you use the XT
test framework to perform a test in a

942
00:52:11,085 --> 00:52:11,138
testament

943
00:52:12,038 --> 00:52:15,135
where you can get at more accurate
results every session later this week of

944
00:52:16,035 --> 00:52:20,132
testing an expert sex which will go into
this and more detail

945
00:52:21,032 --> 00:52:24,060
there are few more limitations of
playgrounds play Dance Camp use for

946
00:52:24,006 --> 00:52:25,034
things which require

947
00:52:25,088 --> 00:52:28,186
user interaction so we have great sport
for showing my views

948
00:52:29,086 --> 00:52:32,130
be can only see them you can't touch
them

949
00:52:33,003 --> 00:52:35,084
we all should not support you can play
counts for anything which require custom

950
00:52:36,011 --> 00:52:37,108
entitlements

951
00:52:38,008 --> 00:52:41,034
for I was playgrounds we only support
executing against the simulator

952
00:52:41,034 --> 00:52:45,109
Sony thing which requires a device I
will not be supported with playgrounds

953
00:52:46,009 --> 00:52:50,036
and finally we do not support using your
own app for free Marco in a playground

954
00:52:50,036 --> 00:52:52,063
I wanted something that you can just
copy and paste into the playground

955
00:52:52,063 --> 00:52:52,071
source

956
00:52:53,043 --> 00:52:56,132
basically you can only use things in the
standard library in the fck

957
00:52:57,032 --> 00:53:00,051
or that in the play concerts self

958
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:03,132
in get around some these limitations by
using the rebel rebel is the command

959
00:53:04,032 --> 00:53:05,066
line interface the swift

960
00:53:05,066 --> 00:53:08,161
and it works this way because at the
rebel can actually executing your own

961
00:53:09,061 --> 00:53:09,140
process

962
00:53:10,004 --> 00:53:14,062
you just stop at a breakpoint and that
the LDP prompt yet few the rebel command

963
00:53:14,098 --> 00:53:17,166
and you'll be destruct down right into
the swift trouble

964
00:53:18,066 --> 00:53:21,085
gonzo provide a richer experience the
red in the rebel that's because you

965
00:53:21,085 --> 00:53:23,091
automatically execute your code from a
non-state

966
00:53:24,045 --> 00:53:27,124
I means you know you make a single edit
to align and then you know we just be

967
00:53:28,024 --> 00:53:29,061
run it from zero

968
00:53:29,061 --> 00:53:32,108
whereas with the rebel if you wanted to
make an avid something earlier in the

969
00:53:33,008 --> 00:53:36,297
source the retainer getting get the
process back into the state

970
00:53:36,369 --> 00:53:39,970
then you re enter the raffle retype
everything making it one change to see

971
00:53:39,097 --> 00:53:41,104
how it affects things

972
00:53:42,004 --> 00:53:44,102
Picasa support from these high-level
features like but looks and the time

973
00:53:45,002 --> 00:53:45,075
line

974
00:53:45,075 --> 00:53:49,114
which we do not support which the rebel
does not support

975
00:53:50,014 --> 00:53:53,106
you like to learn more about the rebel
in go to the introduction to Aldi be in

976
00:53:54,006 --> 00:53:55,041
the swift rebel talk

977
00:53:55,041 --> 00:53:59,050
and we're going to much more detail
about how at the rebel works

978
00:54:00,031 --> 00:54:03,089
in summary we think playgrounds are a
great way play with swift

979
00:54:03,089 --> 00:54:07,107
cocoa and Cocoa Touch you can use them
for things like burning

980
00:54:08,007 --> 00:54:11,806
exploration and visualization and
frankly public on the things that we

981
00:54:11,869 --> 00:54:13,760
haven't even thought of yet

982
00:54:13,076 --> 00:54:16,149
yes the playground framework provides
API's for use in your playgrounds

983
00:54:17,049 --> 00:54:20,101
for more advanced things so you can do
things like menu week after values with

984
00:54:21,001 --> 00:54:23,044
the XCP capture value API

985
00:54:23,044 --> 00:54:26,135
you can show my views and the time I by
calling XCP show view

986
00:54:27,035 --> 00:54:30,132
and you can also extend execution for a
synchronous operations with the XCP said

987
00:54:31,032 --> 00:54:34,067
execution should continue indefinitely
function

988
00:54:34,067 --> 00:54:37,110
finally we really like to think ready to
go out and get pic on the Tri

989
00:54:38,001 --> 00:54:41,010
thank you know the really approachable
and if you just sit down with them for a

990
00:54:41,019 --> 00:54:43,072
little bit you'll find a number of great
ways to integrate them into our

991
00:54:43,072 --> 00:54:45,134
development process

992
00:54:46,034 --> 00:54:49,123
for more information you can contact our
developer tools evangelist Dave too long

993
00:54:50,023 --> 00:54:53,075
assassin information up against the
source editor help racks good sex

994
00:54:53,075 --> 00:54:57,153
you can also ask questions about
playgrounds on the Apple Developer forms

995
00:54:58,053 --> 00:55:01,059
if several related sessions about us
with this week

996
00:55:01,059 --> 00:55:04,094
I so there is an introduction to Swift
session yesterday

997
00:55:04,094 --> 00:55:07,158
which impact on the video we also have
an intermediate sweat session

998
00:55:08,058 --> 00:55:12,587
out later this afternoon there's also in
advance which session at tomorrow which

999
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:14,780
will be able to see

1000
00:55:14,078 --> 00:55:17,104
we had an integrating switch with
objective-c session atlee

1001
00:55:18,004 --> 00:55:21,013
earlier this morning which he kept on
video and we also have

1002
00:55:21,013 --> 00:55:25,013
admits with interoperability in-depth
session later this afternoon

1003
00:55:25,013 --> 00:55:27,066
finally if you'd like to learn more
about the swift Apple you go to the

1004
00:55:27,066 --> 00:55:28,095
introduction to LBB

1005
00:55:28,095 --> 00:55:30,104
in a swift rebel session thank you all
for coming and I hope you have a great

1006
00:55:31,085 --> 00:55:32,101
week here at WWDC
