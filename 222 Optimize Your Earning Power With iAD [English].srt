1
00:00:13,017 --> 00:00:17,049
okay eyler body my name's that they've
also my money i at team

2
00:00:17,049 --> 00:00:20,101
I'm here talking about optimizing your
earning power with

3
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:24,100
I add for this view don't know

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,006
somehow I as apples to do it advertising
platform this is what you use to you

5
00:00:31,006 --> 00:00:31,085
have seen it in

6
00:00:31,085 --> 00:00:35,434
other app soviet-style s accusations
radio and all the ads you see it in 3d

7
00:00:36,199 --> 00:00:37,550
return my iPad

8
00:00:37,055 --> 00:00:42,073
so that's what hired his other two parts
this presentation

9
00:00:42,073 --> 00:00:45,154
really talking first about modernization
how you can

10
00:00:46,054 --> 00:00:49,066
use I had inside your apt to drive
revenue for your app's

11
00:00:49,066 --> 00:00:52,104
a and the second part is promotion are
you can use I had

12
00:00:53,004 --> 00:00:56,363
to get more downloads erupting users
your app take

13
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,130
get your app how in everyone else's
hands Sault star of monetization

14
00:01:02,013 --> 00:01:05,099
sort of fewer pieces talk about here

15
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:08,174
part but some developer benefits what I
acting do for you

16
00:01:09,074 --> 00:01:13,122
part watson core concepts certain
advertising 101

17
00:01:14,022 --> 00:01:17,093
we'll talk about improving performance
how you can best

18
00:01:17,093 --> 00:01:20,126
use I added get the most out of it we'll
talk some

19
00:01:21,026 --> 00:01:24,245
details about the actual code you have
to write in a great I had inside your

20
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:24,547
app which is

21
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:29,510
for sleep pretty simple what little
about testing I had making sure your

22
00:01:29,051 --> 00:01:30,086
gracious actually working

23
00:01:30,086 --> 00:01:34,120
for you now on the App Store and then
just get pucks so it start off with

24
00:01:35,002 --> 00:01:39,010
developer benefits you

25
00:01:39,028 --> 00:01:42,867
up for small I had provides rich

26
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,162
engaging this is a

27
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:50,606
platform that value great ads to go into
the great aP's

28
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,165
you create their high production values

29
00:01:55,579 --> 00:02:00,390
rich media absent rich media ads
involved here these are things that

30
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:00,658
involve

31
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:06,380
video they involve animations their
immersive

32
00:02:06,038 --> 00:02:09,067
these are sometimes entire games
presented inside

33
00:02:09,067 --> 00:02:13,163
ads other isn't allowed recently that
was literally a game once ap

34
00:02:14,063 --> 00:02:17,142
on it this is you things that your users
are actually interested in engaging on

35
00:02:18,042 --> 00:02:21,291
interested in tapping which is great for
you as

36
00:02:21,669 --> 00:02:26,870
a drivers publisher is our award-winning
at

37
00:02:26,087 --> 00:02:30,181
you're not just fly by night you know
one of taps her ads with

38
00:02:31,081 --> 00:02:34,790
link tags and then they're going to
annoy the heck users is a carefully

39
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:36,570
crafted at

40
00:02:36,057 --> 00:02:41,686
that actually look good as part of your
in addition

41
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:45,234
Apple is providing this SDK I

42
00:02:45,549 --> 00:02:48,870
as a result the same care that Apple
takes

43
00:02:48,087 --> 00:02:52,296
with respect to privacy and power
efficiency on the rest

44
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:56,560
Apple system Apple invest in hired as
well

45
00:02:56,056 --> 00:02:59,078
that means that we take care all love
the

46
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:03,173
power and privacy considerations for you
so you don't have to worry about them

47
00:03:04,073 --> 00:03:07,097
no need to worry about a ban would add
tracking switch

48
00:03:07,097 --> 00:03:10,166
you know by Eva your don't worry about
location permissions

49
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:14,985
or making sure that your users privacy

50
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:22,579
and personal data is protected properly
in addition

51
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:26,060
because this is an apple right STK its
party the IRS 2k

52
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:30,044
integration is simple there's nothing
else to installer no

53
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:33,063
static libraries to include there's no
third-party headers to

54
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:36,780
drop in your project clear things up
it's all there to begin with

55
00:03:36,078 --> 00:03:39,627
be up and running with minimal code see
later

56
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:45,900
it's about two lines of code to get
banners in your in addition

57
00:03:45,009 --> 00:03:48,045
along with the rest of the coded other

58
00:03:49,026 --> 00:03:52,875
her with the rest to the SDK that apple
provides great documentation great

59
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:54,590
sample code available to you

60
00:03:54,059 --> 00:03:58,988
on the web sites I did global reach

61
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,660
for fourteen countries now a costly
expanding

62
00:04:02,066 --> 00:04:05,087
larger list two countries than we showed
up here last year a

63
00:04:05,087 --> 00:04:08,796
that means that you're going to get ads
in all those countries

64
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:12,648
inside your app so soon as you get your
ap in all those countries

65
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:19,290
you're going to get revenues countries
as well just like

66
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:22,830
the actual app purchase and then in app
purchases as well

67
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:26,111
journey get seventy percent of the
advertising revenue from I at insider

68
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:31,000
Apple takes a 30 percent share and
everything else goes to you

69
00:04:31,099 --> 00:04:35,050
from whatever we taken from the
advertisers producing these add

70
00:04:35,005 --> 00:04:40,054
to run insider its

71
00:04:40,099 --> 00:04:43,177
very easy for you to get into the IET
ecosystem

72
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:47,933
I a contract on the iTunes Connect Apple
com site you have to sign

73
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:52,150
that's pretty easy here at the I a
framework that's what the rest the stock

74
00:04:52,015 --> 00:04:53,344
is going to be about

75
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:59,538
and they submit your app review and
that's really all you have to do

76
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:04,128
okay so that's sort of what I can do for
you talk about some core concept teaser

77
00:05:04,659 --> 00:05:07,734
some fundamental basics advertising and
some terminology

78
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:12,860
you're going to see especially on the
iTunes Connect website 12 integrated I

79
00:05:12,086 --> 00:05:12,955
at

80
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:20,729
and are trying to track the progress you
getting revenue from my it inside your

81
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:23,827
first well there's an add request you
see this come up

82
00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:27,218
again later you'll see this and metrics
where that request

83
00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:31,460
at the network arrest acres from the
device through the IET framework

84
00:05:31,046 --> 00:05:34,345
its gonna go out to the I ad servers up
the crowd

85
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:39,765
and hopefully ads will come back down to
you a similar ads available for your

86
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:43,830
a particular app in the current
situation up

87
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:46,125
you know again if the user is in a
country where not in

88
00:05:47,025 --> 00:05:51,194
your community at their Fort

89
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:54,990
once you start getting ads from be
difficult request

90
00:05:54,099 --> 00:05:57,128
you want to look at your story this is
the ratio

91
00:05:58,028 --> 00:06:02,053
ads delivered by the ad server to the
number request that you actually make to

92
00:06:02,053 --> 00:06:02,992
the server

93
00:06:03,469 --> 00:06:06,510
this is again in beats per min by where
users are located

94
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:11,910
what type ap you have how well your app
is done with I had in the past

95
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:15,870
we'll get to that little bit a little
later as to how that can be

96
00:06:15,087 --> 00:06:18,906
really important driving your story

97
00:06:19,689 --> 00:06:23,752
once you got Nats a your got near 48
shown as the user

98
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,560
there's Picasa call the tapori this is
the number

99
00:06:27,056 --> 00:06:30,375
the ads that your user has actually
tapped on and thats

100
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:33,920
does not count %uh accidental caps at
the top if

101
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:37,300
taps on it includes a cousin really mean
it that doesn't count

102
00:06:37,003 --> 00:06:41,932
number tops that the user actually meant
to have happen

103
00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:45,276
relative the number as you displayed
user this is something you attempt to

104
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:47,370
maximize inside

105
00:06:47,037 --> 00:06:51,416
your again though accidental caps don't
count so

106
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:54,847
trying to play games not a good idea

107
00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:58,840
at engagement

108
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,112
obviously you need to display the app

109
00:07:02,012 --> 00:07:04,111
erupts when the add to the user doesn't
matter how many have the request from

110
00:07:05,011 --> 00:07:06,090
the server

111
00:07:06,189 --> 00:07:12,195
you're not going to get paid for them I
and at you might as well not bother

112
00:07:12,249 --> 00:07:15,274
want to do that make sure actually fully
visible

113
00:07:15,499 --> 00:07:20,090
as well %uh the fact that it's on screen
and only one pixel over showing because

114
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:21,698
you've got it covered up with something
else

115
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:25,330
that doesn't really count either I'll
you wanna make sure that the ad is

116
00:07:25,033 --> 00:07:27,872
visible for as long as possible

117
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:31,230
leave it on screen again if it shows up

118
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:34,801
and flashes for two seconds known Norris
I

119
00:07:34,999 --> 00:07:38,063
doesn't matter you wanna make sure to
add her on screen this is

120
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,150
has to benefits 1 it's not distracting
to your user

121
00:07:42,015 --> 00:07:45,043
unknowing people by flashing things on
and off screen all the time that people

122
00:07:45,043 --> 00:07:46,862
really don't see

123
00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:51,240
in addition the user has time to
interact with their time see it

124
00:07:51,024 --> 00:07:54,603
its icy its message their time you say
hey you know that actually like to tap

125
00:07:54,819 --> 00:07:55,210
on this

126
00:07:55,021 --> 00:07:59,036
engaged with and see what's going on

127
00:07:59,036 --> 00:08:03,935
I that reason to allow interaction
really easy to put something on screen

128
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:07,311
accidentally cover up especially
actually covering up for something the

129
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:08,855
block user interaction

130
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:13,550
he put a banner on screen you cover up
with something that is a

131
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:16,254
transparent you that does not allow user
traction

132
00:08:16,749 --> 00:08:20,812
can't happen again turn good that I get
situation for the ad users can be trying

133
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:22,380
to tap on it

134
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:25,447
nothing's going to happen hi it's very
bad experience

135
00:08:25,969 --> 00:08:29,969
in addition again your act together
revenue you're hoping for in a certain

136
00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:30,032
situation

137
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:35,130
because the I wasn't really on screen

138
00:08:35,013 --> 00:08:38,038
gets us some socks for core concepts
talk a little about

139
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:41,065
what you can do to improve the
performance I at once you

140
00:08:41,065 --> 00:08:44,934
actually integrated insider first row

141
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,180
revenue starts with your ap I if you
have a great app

142
00:08:50,018 --> 00:08:53,357
it doesn't matter how many energy show
doesn't matter how many show

143
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,551
know when using your app and you're not
going to make any money so the number

144
00:08:56,839 --> 00:08:58,360
one thing you can do you

145
00:08:58,036 --> 00:09:03,048
to drive revenue ads in your app start
off with great

146
00:09:03,048 --> 00:09:06,587
that's what the rest up to this is about
but a couple

147
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:10,110
so small things we can mention here
first or

148
00:09:10,011 --> 00:09:13,018
ap engagement I'm if you're if it
happens

149
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:16,550
you're trying to drive revenue by

150
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,050
showing an you need to make sure that
you have sufficient engagement time for

151
00:09:21,005 --> 00:09:22,023
users to actually

152
00:09:22,023 --> 00:09:26,057
do this if it's a utility app that the
user is going to pull up

153
00:09:26,057 --> 00:09:28,131
it's gonna be on screen for about three
seconds and then they're going to

154
00:09:29,031 --> 00:09:30,860
closure app again

155
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:34,850
that's not enough time to actually show
at Caesars allow interaction

156
00:09:34,085 --> 00:09:37,324
and get interaction from those users so
you needn't out

157
00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:41,094
actually is going to be on-screen and

158
00:09:41,139 --> 00:09:44,480
that you actually want to engage again

159
00:09:44,048 --> 00:09:47,347
%uh once you've done that you wanna make
sure that the ad is placed carefully

160
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:49,440
with in that

161
00:09:49,044 --> 00:09:52,107
think about what the users doing on the
various screens your app make sure the

162
00:09:53,007 --> 00:09:53,886
ad is placed

163
00:09:53,949 --> 00:09:57,957
appropriately within the app if you
could gain for instance

164
00:09:58,029 --> 00:10:02,470
a and the user's tapping and swiping
placing constantly

165
00:10:02,047 --> 00:10:04,091
maybe that's not a great place for
banner where they're going to be

166
00:10:04,091 --> 00:10:05,187
actually tapping

167
00:10:06,087 --> 00:10:09,088
the ad will pop up over the top of
everything you're going to be knowing

168
00:10:09,088 --> 00:10:09,917
your users

169
00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:13,721
and you're going to be harming your app
morning here

170
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:17,866
helping it with

171
00:10:18,199 --> 00:10:21,280
up phone back into wrapping it in time
user loyalty

172
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:25,016
you need to come unique users to come
back to the apt

173
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:28,174
the app repeatedly that's how you get
more screen time that's

174
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:34,034
more time for this particular for
showing ads to users

175
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,117
in addition your loyalty is what drives
I had

176
00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:40,508
ap engagement with tribes app downloads
serve

177
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:44,043
network effects never before more people
re: using your apt more

178
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:48,040
they want to use it morning to tell
their friends about using an

179
00:10:48,004 --> 00:10:51,079
more down you're going to get therefore
the more i bothering it looking at

180
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:54,068
within your

181
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,820
I'll I mentioned that I as in 14
countries

182
00:10:57,082 --> 00:11:00,113
that means that your ap should be in 14
countries if you want

183
00:11:01,013 --> 00:11:06,088
get as most the most revenue from as you
can

184
00:11:06,088 --> 00:11:09,091
market your apt to the country's were I
it actually is

185
00:11:09,091 --> 00:11:12,099
your if spent the time in a great I it
into your app

186
00:11:12,099 --> 00:11:15,888
you wanna make sure the rap is in all
the places that I it is see you have

187
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:19,802
the largest reach possible to
potentially get the most users

188
00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:23,130
possible for your a big part of that is

189
00:11:23,013 --> 00:11:27,652
localizing your the only thing you've
done is right here happen English

190
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:30,870
you're trying to get in all 14 these
countries are gonna have a hard time in

191
00:11:30,087 --> 00:11:30,676
countries

192
00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:34,810
where English is a small presence but
you take the time to look closer

193
00:11:34,081 --> 00:11:35,110
appropriately

194
00:11:36,001 --> 00:11:41,070
drive users in those country

195
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:44,086
back into ad placement a little bit
because this is a

196
00:11:44,086 --> 00:11:47,365
the sonic you coming back to you ad
placement is

197
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:51,146
extraordinarily important thing

198
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:54,253
you'll recognize hi use areas inside
your am

199
00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:58,240
you wanna make sure you put banners
inside those areas there's the places

200
00:11:58,024 --> 00:11:59,075
where users are going to be a

201
00:11:59,075 --> 00:12:02,474
looking at screen for a long period of
time to have the opportunity to see the

202
00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:03,204
app

203
00:12:03,699 --> 00:12:07,706
the at their apt to engage with yet

204
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:11,420
at the same time as I mentioned avoid
actor perhaps

205
00:12:11,042 --> 00:12:15,055
axle caps are bad for user and they're
bad for you

206
00:12:15,055 --> 00:12:19,100
%uh they're gonna know your user and ir
doesn't like actual taps either's

207
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,829
you wanna make sure you are using the
framework in a way that does not

208
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:24,860
encourage them

209
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:29,215
is your Apple ultimately end up being
penalized for this

210
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:32,936
your contacts is really important unit

211
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:38,274
taken into different types of ads based
on what the users doing a given time

212
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:41,851
say the user is on the menu screen your
game maybe that's a great post

213
00:12:42,589 --> 00:12:46,606
banner at the bottom screen looking at
the menu maybe they noticed the app

214
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:49,810
at the at the bottom maybe happening
gate with

215
00:12:49,081 --> 00:12:52,129
the same time if they tap to go to the
first love your game

216
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:56,998
and you immediately Papa full-fledged
add an interrupt their experience what

217
00:12:57,259 --> 00:12:57,560
they've

218
00:12:57,056 --> 00:13:00,585
once they've done their first actions
game that's just going to annoy them

219
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:03,180
you're gonna drive users away

220
00:13:03,018 --> 00:13:06,907
want to engage with the ad that's what
you want to try to avoid

221
00:13:07,069 --> 00:13:13,108
be very careful about where you're
putting ads within your

222
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:17,496
once you've integrated I add new can
start looking on the website

223
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:21,866
you'll start getting reports about your
revenue when things are gonna notice

224
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:26,620
everyone always nurses and brings I'm is
that revenue will fluctuate

225
00:13:26,062 --> 00:13:30,771
this is perfectly natural consumer
spending is seasonal

226
00:13:31,329 --> 00:13:35,336
advertiser spending is also seasonal
because consumer spending is

227
00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:39,077
you need to be aware of this and watch
for it you can also take advantage of

228
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:41,000
this

229
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,009
market your app accordingly started
summer

230
00:13:45,009 --> 00:13:48,370
back to school holiday season these are
the times when

231
00:13:48,037 --> 00:13:51,043
users are going to out to get new
devices going

232
00:13:51,043 --> 00:13:54,382
how to get new maps and advertisers a
going out to get

233
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:57,857
eyeballs insiders maps so that's when
you want rain get

234
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:05,410
dude try and put all your money and
pushing your app

235
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:08,150
okay we talked about ads talk about
impressions

236
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:12,180
talk about captors we talked about rate

237
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:16,487
this is a virtuous cycle gonna get as to
begin with

238
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:19,673
they really don't pressions impressions
are lead to tap throughs

239
00:14:19,889 --> 00:14:23,230
more tapped as you get more agile and
get from the ad server

240
00:14:23,023 --> 00:14:26,111
corporations are gonna get

241
00:14:27,011 --> 00:14:30,980
okay so that performance now we've done
that knowing going it's an actual

242
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,560
details about how you

243
00:14:32,056 --> 00:14:37,099
actually about a great deal stuff
certain me to stock

244
00:14:37,099 --> 00:14:41,174
as for a performance banner as
interstitial ernie direct

245
00:14:42,074 --> 00:14:45,283
and there's a pre-roll video ad we'll
talk about it these foreign

246
00:14:45,949 --> 00:14:50,480
turn I as I mentioned earlier you can
watch you the correct

247
00:14:50,048 --> 00:14:53,074
add for your app in the various contexts
within your app

248
00:14:53,074 --> 00:14:56,603
so all four these types of ads are
important

249
00:14:57,269 --> 00:15:01,330
from many many perhaps

250
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:04,940
start of a banner

251
00:15:04,094 --> 00:15:09,118
so what is a banner slim device with you

252
00:15:10,018 --> 00:15:13,547
both bought a mature content

253
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:16,733
continuously load ads United other

254
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:20,370
I S Decatur at a stick is where you got
makes

255
00:15:20,037 --> 00:15:23,926
West this isn't that you create a view
shop the bottom the page

256
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:28,292
and continuously load ads over time as
new as a delegate from the answer

257
00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:31,940
something you have to do to manage that

258
00:15:31,094 --> 00:15:37,094
one sees a taps on it going going some
sort of four screen at experience

259
00:15:37,094 --> 00:15:42,186
at supportable iPhone iPad has been
since the beginning I

260
00:15:43,086 --> 00:15:48,093
integrating banners in your app is about
the simplest thing that you could do

261
00:15:48,093 --> 00:15:51,992
there's three steps this you can link
the IET framework

262
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:55,850
you're going to you import the IOD

263
00:15:55,085 --> 00:15:58,874
import the I editor which is the first
line up there and reconfigure your view

264
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:00,688
controller which involves setting

265
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:05,430
can display banner ads property yes on
your controller

266
00:16:05,043 --> 00:16:10,822
that's it if you've done that you've got
a banner inside your apt

267
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:14,500
so does that look like okay loading at

268
00:16:14,005 --> 00:16:18,005
you got your review the moment you set
the can display banner ads property on

269
00:16:18,005 --> 00:16:18,324
it

270
00:16:18,819 --> 00:16:21,832
we're gonna do something under the hood
to your view controller

271
00:16:21,949 --> 00:16:25,110
your view is going to turn into original
content

272
00:16:25,011 --> 00:16:28,040
we're gonna move your view over to
original content you and we're gonna

273
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:30,180
take a review in your view controller

274
00:16:30,018 --> 00:16:34,277
very important for you to remember subs
subsequently attempted to access your

275
00:16:34,439 --> 00:16:37,790
view on that you can't roller

276
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,124
willing to make a request that the ad
server to come back and hopefully a

277
00:16:41,024 --> 00:16:41,029
better

278
00:16:41,074 --> 00:16:44,783
load at that time we're going to you

279
00:16:45,449 --> 00:16:49,120
move the banner on-screen resize your
account

280
00:16:49,012 --> 00:16:52,111
you appropriately with the for free
animation to move the thing on screens

281
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:57,920
user can actually look at it

282
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:01,660
want to spend on screen for a while over
the years gonna go ahead tap on it

283
00:17:01,066 --> 00:17:05,148
at that point before screen at
experience gonna pop up

284
00:17:06,048 --> 00:17:09,110
when that happens a couple things you
need to do for switches to pause

285
00:17:10,001 --> 00:17:15,003
activity if you will disappear your app
is probably doing things the background

286
00:17:15,012 --> 00:17:19,054
banners on screen when the user wants to
engage with the ad you want to get

287
00:17:19,054 --> 00:17:23,133
out of the way if you're playing music
if you're running a game simulation you

288
00:17:24,033 --> 00:17:25,045
doing anything else

289
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:28,143
tensely intensive or distracting
menopause activity and you will

290
00:17:29,043 --> 00:17:30,046
disappear

291
00:17:30,046 --> 00:17:33,055
so that it out of the way at

292
00:17:34,036 --> 00:17:37,063
eventually the user will be done
interacting with the ample dismiss it

293
00:17:37,063 --> 00:17:40,121
you know yet if you did appear resume
all that activity

294
00:17:41,021 --> 00:17:44,048
has gone you wanna start the music up
again you wanna start games

295
00:17:44,048 --> 00:17:47,137
nations her

296
00:17:48,037 --> 00:17:51,100
eventually said user goes out of network
connectivity or something

297
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,047
you may not have an Advil anymore when
that happens

298
00:17:56,047 --> 00:17:59,144
the better going to be moved off-screen
your original content you will be

299
00:18:00,044 --> 00:18:01,143
resized

300
00:18:02,043 --> 00:18:06,121
and and you can to wait hopefully
reloads again

301
00:18:07,021 --> 00:18:11,048
in addition to waiting for the network
connectivity just movie bareback

302
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:14,094
screen you can control the better
visibility whenever you would like

303
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:17,143
if something happens within your app
that you would like to move to bear on

304
00:18:18,043 --> 00:18:18,142
screen Temperley

305
00:18:19,042 --> 00:18:22,088
go ahead and do so just go ahead and set
can display banner ads

306
00:18:22,088 --> 00:18:25,143
no just don't forget said backed yes

307
00:18:26,043 --> 00:18:29,068
when you wanna re enable it actually put
that back on screen

308
00:18:29,068 --> 00:18:32,133
whenever you actually need

309
00:18:33,033 --> 00:18:36,117
okay that betters what's likely
interstitials next

310
00:18:37,017 --> 00:18:40,040
second major type banner her to batter

311
00:18:40,004 --> 00:18:44,009
very different and better rather than
something being permanently on screen

312
00:18:44,009 --> 00:18:48,016
their immediate for screen display
immediately take over the entire screen

313
00:18:48,097 --> 00:18:49,156
when you want present them

314
00:18:50,056 --> 00:18:53,061
is very is immediately able to interact
with them

315
00:18:54,006 --> 00:18:58,028
they were iPad since I was 4.3 and their
interest

316
00:18:58,028 --> 00:19:02,090
on phone in Iowa 7 last year

317
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:05,009
there's two major ways to handle
interstitial presentation

318
00:19:05,009 --> 00:19:08,012
first automatic presentation just like
banners

319
00:19:08,093 --> 00:19:11,177
it's pretty simple to configure here
residents I think and display banner ads

320
00:19:12,077 --> 00:19:15,082
you're gonna set interstitial
presentation policy

321
00:19:15,082 --> 00:19:18,085
eighty interstitial presentation policy
automatic

322
00:19:18,085 --> 00:19:22,122
what that does is tell the I framework
hey this is a great view controller

323
00:19:23,022 --> 00:19:27,041
show ads all and whenever you as the eye
from work thinkers

324
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:30,135
great time ads go ahead and do so

325
00:19:31,035 --> 00:19:34,043
at moment that means that we're gonna
show ads when this me

326
00:19:34,043 --> 00:19:37,055
it when issue controller for on-screen
it appears

327
00:19:37,055 --> 00:19:41,129
take that as an opportunity to show airs
if one is available

328
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:45,083
so to do that just take your view
controller put it on screen make

329
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:50,090
in your allegations back or however you
want on-screen that moves in

330
00:19:50,009 --> 00:19:53,065
and we're gonna pop and add up over top
of it when the user's done interacting

331
00:19:54,046 --> 00:19:54,117
with them

332
00:19:55,017 --> 00:19:58,048
he'll come back all mission to

333
00:19:58,048 --> 00:20:01,050
automatic presentation there's men your
presentation

334
00:20:01,068 --> 00:20:04,077
just a presentation policy to initial
presentation policy manual

335
00:20:05,058 --> 00:20:08,060
and instead of of automatically
presenting it whenever the moves on

336
00:20:08,078 --> 00:20:08,086
screen

337
00:20:09,058 --> 00:20:12,147
you can call request interstitial at
presentation to attempt to display it

338
00:20:13,047 --> 00:20:15,061
whatever you think it's an appropriate
time for at

339
00:20:15,061 --> 00:20:22,061
pop over top your content

340
00:20:23,008 --> 00:20:26,011
next preparing for inter for for
presentation I

341
00:20:26,011 --> 00:20:29,048
because interstitial don't have
something on-screen something

342
00:20:29,048 --> 00:20:32,052
sitting there requesting and attending
this playthings all times

343
00:20:32,088 --> 00:20:36,127
you want to notify the iron framework
that you would like to present printer

344
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:40,079
future so we can go ahead and make an
add request have an air strikes

345
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:43,094
interstitial waiting for you when that
time comes

346
00:20:43,094 --> 00:20:47,097
do that you're going to want to you call

347
00:20:47,097 --> 00:20:50,195
you a view controller prepare
interstitial ads inside

348
00:20:51,095 --> 00:20:54,191
something early in Europe's life cycle
application did finish watching

349
00:20:55,091 --> 00:20:58,092
options good opportunity here you doing
a lot of other work

350
00:20:59,001 --> 00:21:03,040
that point maybe for a little bit but
you wanna call this prior to your

351
00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:03,770
attempted

352
00:21:03,077 --> 00:21:06,169
present show for the first time back is
the II framework

353
00:21:07,069 --> 00:21:10,098
enough time got network a question had

354
00:21:10,098 --> 00:21:14,099
have everything ready to present by the
time you walk 12 percent

355
00:21:14,099 --> 00:21:17,103
present prevent you from missing at
opportunities

356
00:21:18,003 --> 00:21:21,028
it's that banners in your specials

357
00:21:21,028 --> 00:21:24,060
where we go from here into a quick demo
a just have

358
00:21:24,006 --> 00:21:28,055
the API's I just went over switch over
to you

359
00:21:29,009 --> 00:21:33,098
my demo machine

360
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:37,410
I'll or start off with a router from my
lap

361
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:40,190
is a very simple Master Detail

362
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,070
happier shares news articles i cant
click

363
00:21:44,007 --> 00:21:47,996
here news articles and bring it up and
we would like to take this app

364
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:51,210
and as a matter monetize I had

365
00:21:51,021 --> 00:21:54,025
cell quits again here

366
00:21:54,025 --> 00:21:57,109
what do you want to do here first first
thing your gonna do

367
00:21:58,009 --> 00:22:02,032
is at a banner the bottom the master
view control at the bar

368
00:22:02,032 --> 00:22:05,046
article list so insider matter view
controller here

369
00:22:05,046 --> 00:22:08,113
we're going to you import the eye at her

370
00:22:09,013 --> 00:22:12,016
like this an inside

371
00:22:12,016 --> 00:22:15,028
a week from New already has cost set can

372
00:22:15,028 --> 00:22:20,054
self Kansas display banner ads yes and
that's really all we have to do

373
00:22:20,054 --> 00:22:23,150
up one more thing we need to go in here

374
00:22:24,005 --> 00:22:27,044
faces and ensure that we link

375
00:22:27,089 --> 00:22:33,096
NCIS framework make sure the

376
00:22:33,096 --> 00:22:37,122
API's are actually available to us back
to you master view controller

377
00:22:38,022 --> 00:22:45,022
run and

378
00:22:45,082 --> 00:22:48,107
will see that with two lines code and
one link

379
00:22:49,007 --> 00:22:52,012
we have enters the bottom or screen and
are automatically

380
00:22:52,057 --> 00:22:55,061
in line with our view controller now

381
00:22:55,097 --> 00:22:58,105
we only set that on the master you can
that means

382
00:22:59,005 --> 00:23:02,010
we go into an article there's no and
there a little bit unfortunate

383
00:23:02,055 --> 00:23:05,079
so the next thing we want to do is take
advantage have

384
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:09,080
the other time add we talk about
interstitials to present an add

385
00:23:09,008 --> 00:23:12,089
to the user prior to them actually being
able to read the articles

386
00:23:13,061 --> 00:23:16,065
tap on the article title

387
00:23:16,065 --> 00:23:20,082
one at the pop-up up the screen before
they can actually see the article

388
00:23:20,082 --> 00:23:23,133
so what's good with this again

389
00:23:24,033 --> 00:23:27,034
miss time we're going to you

390
00:23:27,034 --> 00:23:31,863
down here inside our prepare for Segway

391
00:23:32,169 --> 00:23:35,330
want set up the detail view controller
that

392
00:23:35,033 --> 00:23:38,262
shows the actual article we're going to
you

393
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,840
grab this destination interstitial
presentation policy

394
00:23:42,084 --> 00:23:45,178
eighty interstitial presentation policy
automatic so we can say that

395
00:23:46,078 --> 00:23:49,149
on this detail you can to learn things
showing the article we want me i a

396
00:23:50,049 --> 00:23:51,111
framework to manage

397
00:23:52,011 --> 00:23:55,044
presentation interstitial ads over top
this

398
00:23:55,044 --> 00:23:58,058
view controller once we've done that

399
00:23:58,058 --> 00:24:01,123
that's gonna get interstitial showed you
control however

400
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:05,037
we want to make sure that hired from
work knows to go out and look for

401
00:24:05,037 --> 00:24:05,109
interstitials

402
00:24:06,009 --> 00:24:10,838
before the user taps an article for the
first time is to do that when you go

403
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:11,945
over here bring it to our

404
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:16,640
app delegate here I was gonna grab you I
view controller

405
00:24:16,064 --> 00:24:21,129
prepare interstitial an ounce make sure
we for the headers well

406
00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:26,037
that so tired hey governor social at so
they're ready for

407
00:24:26,037 --> 00:24:29,125
are you there and save this run our

408
00:24:30,025 --> 00:24:34,057
demo again once again

409
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:37,132
at the article view here we've got a
pair looked at the bottom that happened

410
00:24:38,032 --> 00:24:41,881
now on taps nurse the

411
00:24:42,169 --> 00:24:45,260
interstitial as going to pop up over top
the article

412
00:24:45,026 --> 00:24:48,945
once the hurry time's expired user done
interacting with this

413
00:24:49,179 --> 00:24:53,090
thinking going close that and the
article behind and they can go in Surrey

414
00:24:53,009 --> 00:24:56,077
article so that's basically how easy it
is

415
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:59,146
to you integrate banners and
interstitials

416
00:25:00,046 --> 00:25:07,046
to your am so go back to sleep

417
00:25:07,057 --> 00:25:10,061
it so it's better than your specials for
the first two major types

418
00:25:10,061 --> 00:25:13,159
%uh ads for I add they're also the first
two types

419
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:18,120
as I those are the ones are available
from the beginning I

420
00:25:19,002 --> 00:25:22,711
a couple newer types that we've got
first you type

421
00:25:22,909 --> 00:25:27,933
some prepares sorry

422
00:25:28,149 --> 00:25:32,130
for small use can't believe in rats

423
00:25:32,013 --> 00:25:35,021
and initial presentation policy under
controllers

424
00:25:35,021 --> 00:25:38,052
as much as possible we talked about had

425
00:25:38,052 --> 00:25:42,134
engagement we talked about the user
having the opportunity to see the ads

426
00:25:43,034 --> 00:25:46,103
leaving them on screen is having the
option to engage with yet

427
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:51,097
setting these properties is a big part

428
00:25:51,097 --> 00:25:55,184
in addition rumor user to content when
you actually use can display banner

429
00:25:56,084 --> 00:25:59,893
it's very important that 12 seconds bear
as you realize that

430
00:26:00,649 --> 00:26:04,370
you've given over control you too the
right framework

431
00:26:04,037 --> 00:26:11,037
and original content view is yours to
continue using

432
00:26:12,399 --> 00:26:16,090
victory transitions for interstitials
think about what your user is

433
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:19,013
doing at any given time when they're
transitioning from view controller you

434
00:26:19,013 --> 00:26:19,100
controller

435
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,008
and make sure that interstitial
presentation policy automatic

436
00:26:23,008 --> 00:26:26,069
set on the appropriate view controllers
for at the show up

437
00:26:26,069 --> 00:26:29,308
when they first pop-up for instance in
the

438
00:26:29,929 --> 00:26:34,210
news-democrat showed you having that
show up on

439
00:26:34,021 --> 00:26:37,114
the main article: list probably not
appropriate I would just be distracting

440
00:26:38,014 --> 00:26:38,553
and annoying

441
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:41,790
use having on the article view
controller

442
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:45,122
on the other hand just gives a gating
function to allowing the user to

443
00:26:46,022 --> 00:26:53,022
actually future content the appropriate
for the interstitial

444
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:56,032
be consistent writer navigation stacking
yes

445
00:26:56,059 --> 00:26:59,121
up this is particularly important for
navigation controllers

446
00:27:00,021 --> 00:27:03,059
record deep navigation controllers I'll

447
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:07,070
what I mean by this is in particular
with can display banner

448
00:27:07,007 --> 00:27:10,056
if you have a deep navigation RK you
want to attempt a sec and its way better

449
00:27:11,019 --> 00:27:12,032
at times many

450
00:27:12,032 --> 00:27:15,111
love the view controllers going to
prison pushing in a hierarchy is

451
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:16,470
possible

452
00:27:16,047 --> 00:27:20,072
to ensure that the ad remains on screen
as the user navigates throughout that

453
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:21,127
hierarchy

454
00:27:22,027 --> 00:27:25,123
otherwise you have the possibility the
at popping up on screen for second

455
00:27:26,023 --> 00:27:29,058
taps on something akers back away it up

456
00:27:29,058 --> 00:27:32,101
have to something else yet comes back
that's distracting

457
00:27:33,001 --> 00:27:37,037
your user at the same time it doesn't
allow the ad stay on screen

458
00:27:37,037 --> 00:27:43,078
long enough for the user to actually
engage with that

459
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:46,107
okay now our with their specials

460
00:27:46,809 --> 00:27:49,870
let's talk about media wrecked which is
the next major type

461
00:27:49,087 --> 00:27:52,092
had that I it provides

462
00:27:53,037 --> 00:27:57,099
what is a medium racked is n
International Advertising Bureau medium

463
00:27:57,099 --> 00:27:57,198
rectangle

464
00:27:58,098 --> 00:28:02,195
standard at time positioned in line with
your content

465
00:28:03,095 --> 00:28:06,130
standard I saw as the same size as you
may have seen

466
00:28:07,003 --> 00:28:10,060
browsing the web square rectangular as

467
00:28:10,087 --> 00:28:13,173
in line with wet contact the same type
and got

468
00:28:14,073 --> 00:28:18,085
just like banners they automatically
cycle overtime

469
00:28:18,085 --> 00:28:21,086
so you put them on screen new ads will
be loaded

470
00:28:21,086 --> 00:28:24,138
II framework feel appropriate will
automatically manage making requests and

471
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:25,120
putting

472
00:28:26,002 --> 00:28:30,011
for you and just like banners

473
00:28:30,029 --> 00:28:35,098
there's a force creat experience once
the taps on engages with this banner

474
00:28:35,098 --> 00:28:38,176
their introduced Iowa 6 on iPad

475
00:28:39,076 --> 00:28:46,076
and happy to announce that and I was 8
we're adding this to phone as well

476
00:28:47,399 --> 00:28:50,450
yet so it's a medium light rectangle
life cycle look like

477
00:28:50,909 --> 00:28:55,820
%uh because these banners are not
managed by the I add

478
00:28:55,082 --> 00:28:58,108
framework a you have to do a little bit
more work

479
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:02,057
to put these on screen

480
00:29:02,129 --> 00:29:05,181
and create the banner explicitly rather
than just selling property you

481
00:29:05,649 --> 00:29:07,540
controller

482
00:29:07,054 --> 00:29:10,059
you configure delegate school hours tell
you when certain things happen we're

483
00:29:11,004 --> 00:29:11,081
getting thicker

484
00:29:11,081 --> 00:29:14,132
this backslide implement the delicate
protocol

485
00:29:15,032 --> 00:29:19,059
so you can actually take their citizens
thing on and off screen as the

486
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:22,104
better load on loans

487
00:29:23,004 --> 00:29:26,011
show the banner when you receive the
better view did load and property

488
00:29:26,074 --> 00:29:29,151
are dog collar you're gonna pause
activity

489
00:29:30,051 --> 00:29:34,058
in better view action should begin will
leave application this is analogous

490
00:29:34,058 --> 00:29:37,060
to getting you will disappear message
from

491
00:29:37,006 --> 00:29:40,006
interstitials or banners and

492
00:29:40,006 --> 00:29:43,049
you want to resume activity and
interview action finish analogous to you

493
00:29:44,003 --> 00:29:44,034
will

494
00:29:44,034 --> 00:29:47,323
here your high the banner

495
00:29:47,629 --> 00:29:51,770
interview did fail to see that there
important this indicates that year

496
00:29:51,077 --> 00:29:56,146
better no longer has loaded should no
longer be taking up space on screen

497
00:29:57,046 --> 00:30:01,047
so does look like first or creating
better

498
00:30:01,047 --> 00:30:04,055
import the I had her Top Gear

499
00:30:04,055 --> 00:30:07,144
implement a deep interview delegate on
whatever object you would like to

500
00:30:08,044 --> 00:30:11,109
actually be managing this particular
banner

501
00:30:12,009 --> 00:30:15,062
there to create the better view do that
with in it with at type

502
00:30:15,062 --> 00:30:19,111
Adia type medium rectangle and there to
set the delegate

503
00:30:19,669 --> 00:30:22,695
to the object implementing tell your
protocol

504
00:30:22,929 --> 00:30:25,950
sort that out a protocol like home first

505
00:30:25,095 --> 00:30:28,111
I was a me im recollection costar

506
00:30:29,011 --> 00:30:32,050
unloaded we first create there's nothing
in there women request

507
00:30:32,149 --> 00:30:35,750
something to put on screen so don't put
it on screen when you first created

508
00:30:35,075 --> 00:30:39,162
it's just going to be a blank slide and
we're gonna send you an air

509
00:30:40,062 --> 00:30:43,084
once you get a better view did your dad
that's your cue that

510
00:30:43,084 --> 00:30:48,086
there's an ad available inside your
redirect you should move it on-screen

511
00:30:48,086 --> 00:30:51,158
early the better on screen as long as it
has an remember to

512
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:55,100
that this was something its first
repositioned in line with your content

513
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,139
when you move it on screen when you
leavin screen make sure that it

514
00:30:59,139 --> 00:31:03,230
within the rest if your company if you
have an article and you put me in right

515
00:31:03,023 --> 00:31:04,109
on screen with the article texan flow

516
00:31:05,009 --> 00:31:08,010
rounded inside ScrollView scroll with
the

517
00:31:08,019 --> 00:31:11,988
rest your content that's what this type
at is intended

518
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:15,320
for

519
00:31:15,032 --> 00:31:18,053
remove the bareback off-screen better
viewed it failed to receive

520
00:31:18,053 --> 00:31:21,922
with their again once you move it off
screen is your responsibility to reflow

521
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:23,570
your content

522
00:31:23,057 --> 00:31:28,071
to fill the hole left by the

523
00:31:28,071 --> 00:31:33,270
at that time 10 screen your ebook

524
00:31:33,909 --> 00:31:36,560
this is what better loading or unloading
to look like you're in there is too

525
00:31:36,056 --> 00:31:37,675
important tell your call backs here

526
00:31:38,179 --> 00:31:42,820
interview did load and I in which case
is gonna put the banner on screen

527
00:31:42,082 --> 00:31:45,151
randall layer a better view detailed
receive an

528
00:31:45,889 --> 00:31:49,480
air he removed from the review you need
to converse

529
00:31:49,048 --> 00:31:52,056
again layout free for your content
around the whole

530
00:31:52,056 --> 00:31:55,124
left by the bear

531
00:31:56,024 --> 00:32:00,109
the best practices from erecting again
this a great for reform content

532
00:32:01,009 --> 00:32:04,062
the sort of thing put inside ScrollView
within

533
00:32:04,062 --> 00:32:07,101
the rest your content that may scroll up
and down

534
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:10,760
along the device thing on and off-screen
its

535
00:32:10,076 --> 00:32:14,085
sort static with the rest your content
flows around

536
00:32:14,085 --> 00:32:19,384
fill the hole with inside the space on
screen

537
00:32:20,149 --> 00:32:23,152
it's got a full screen out on top.
remember that

538
00:32:23,179 --> 00:32:27,250
a tension that they are they'll get call
backs for will begin action

539
00:32:27,025 --> 00:32:31,121
did finish actions you can pause and
resume activity

540
00:32:32,021 --> 00:32:35,076
positive interview action should begin

541
00:32:35,076 --> 00:32:38,152
and resume activity in the interview
action finish

542
00:32:39,052 --> 00:32:42,171
thats medium rectangle little bit more
complicated than the banner

543
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:45,750
because you have to manage position
yourself but still fairly simple to

544
00:32:45,075 --> 00:32:47,149
implement

545
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:51,698
okay fourth typeof ad that we're talking
about here

546
00:32:52,139 --> 00:32:55,540
is the pre-roll

547
00:32:55,054 --> 00:32:59,135
was a pre-roll video pre-roll it's a
short video that place between

548
00:33:00,035 --> 00:33:04,096
before your own media content

549
00:33:04,096 --> 00:33:08,099
for screen at on tap just like the other
better times

550
00:33:08,099 --> 00:33:11,181
added Iowa 7 and

551
00:33:12,081 --> 00:33:15,103
and I 07 we had on MP movie player
controller

552
00:33:16,003 --> 00:33:19,892
and knew it I was it we're also adding
it on AV player view controller

553
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,850
you a ticket visitor introduced to DC

554
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:27,874
this is available on both iPhone and
iPad it has been since

555
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:32,330
action I wanna circle back to the very
first

556
00:33:32,033 --> 00:33:35,101
bullet here short video please refer
content this is really important

557
00:33:36,001 --> 00:33:40,006
this is not an interstitial style this
is something we played before your

558
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:42,170
contacts so you need to make sure that
you actually

559
00:33:42,629 --> 00:33:46,730
a video to play after we don't want

560
00:33:46,073 --> 00:33:49,170
not support for you to attempt to use
this just you land random at Interbrand

561
00:33:50,007 --> 00:33:53,061
I'm sure that you have content followed
so the

562
00:33:54,024 --> 00:33:57,076
API sign for

563
00:33:57,076 --> 00:34:01,108
so setting up in playback also fairly
straightforward here sort of by linking

564
00:34:02,008 --> 00:34:02,017
the media player I

565
00:34:02,098 --> 00:34:05,130
frameworks important media I at heathers

566
00:34:06,003 --> 00:34:09,035
a great player help pre-roll video

567
00:34:09,062 --> 00:34:12,083
an airplane cockpit video very
straightforward it

568
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:15,144
almost all those except the IOD thats
and they play pre-roll

569
00:34:16,044 --> 00:34:19,503
you already have to do if you got your
own assist few

570
00:34:19,899 --> 00:34:22,948
pay additional lines so is that look
like

571
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:28,010
first important nuclear import I had

572
00:34:28,001 --> 00:34:32,049
Creek and in the player controller in it
was cut in Euros you already would

573
00:34:32,049 --> 00:34:35,081
add that movie player into your you
iraqis

574
00:34:35,081 --> 00:34:38,127
on-screen called your layout for once

575
00:34:39,027 --> 00:34:44,035
there as well and their call play
pre-roll ad with completion

576
00:34:44,035 --> 00:34:47,039
input call this unserved immediately
calling plan this still

577
00:34:47,075 --> 00:34:51,128
I add hey try to put a pre-roll video in
there if you've got one

578
00:34:52,028 --> 00:34:55,647
play that first this takes a completion
handler

579
00:34:55,899 --> 00:34:59,980
return air possibly if something went
wrong inside the completion handler is

580
00:34:59,098 --> 00:34:59,197
your cue to start

581
00:35:00,097 --> 00:35:04,110
your content you wanna make sure you
don't automatically for your country you

582
00:35:05,001 --> 00:35:07,084
wanna Paul your company until this
actually begins

583
00:35:07,093 --> 00:35:10,174
playing or two the people finishes plane
you want to begin your

584
00:35:11,074 --> 00:35:14,115
content for a ticket

585
00:35:15,015 --> 00:35:18,044
almost identical occurred if the player
view controller insider

586
00:35:18,044 --> 00:35:21,078
import the ATK headers a and your call

587
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:24,082
again played hero I with completion
handler as identical semantics

588
00:35:25,018 --> 00:35:28,907
and media player controller ones inside
the completion handler

589
00:35:29,069 --> 00:35:32,480
your call player play to start your own
video-content

590
00:35:32,048 --> 00:35:37,070
afterward this is new I see

591
00:35:37,007 --> 00:35:40,626
just like interstitials because this is
something that is going to happen at

592
00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:42,120
some point

593
00:35:42,012 --> 00:35:45,981
and you won't have I it prepare for need
tell the IAC from work hey

594
00:35:46,089 --> 00:35:49,190
I'm gonna what play freerolls in the
future

595
00:35:49,019 --> 00:35:53,168
that allows us to the opportunity to go
out the ad server grab ads

596
00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:56,387
and be ready for your request freerolls
that we can actually play one when the

597
00:35:56,819 --> 00:35:59,810
user does something that requires it

598
00:35:59,081 --> 00:36:02,156
to do that just interstitial don't miss
these early impressions

599
00:36:03,056 --> 00:36:07,089
to get a lost art add request early by
calling MP movie player controller

600
00:36:07,089 --> 00:36:10,093
prepare pre-roll ads again probably
application did

601
00:36:11,029 --> 00:36:14,067
launching options or some other early

602
00:36:14,067 --> 00:36:17,096
wraps life cycle period so we haven't
had an opportunity to get

603
00:36:17,096 --> 00:36:20,114
hats for you before you call guys

604
00:36:21,014 --> 00:36:24,983
if using AB kit almost ethical I every
player controller prepare

605
00:36:25,109 --> 00:36:28,185
croats instead

606
00:36:28,869 --> 00:36:32,480
go best practices for video then

607
00:36:32,048 --> 00:36:35,091
don't play content until the I completes

608
00:36:35,091 --> 00:36:38,135
if you called a pre-roll ad and

609
00:36:39,035 --> 00:36:42,066
ap second later you call play before
with culture

610
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:45,072
which inhaler we're going to interrupted

611
00:36:46,026 --> 00:36:50,135
you know killing is a very common case
for this

612
00:36:50,369 --> 00:36:55,010
this can interrupt playing a free ride
me it's kept going to go to your content

613
00:36:55,001 --> 00:36:58,045
like the ad never played except that
it's poor user experience for users

614
00:36:58,045 --> 00:37:01,051
you'd like to try to avoid this one
possible so make sure that you

615
00:37:02,005 --> 00:37:05,030
wat into our completion call to call
play

616
00:37:05,003 --> 00:37:08,052
for verifications is frequently means
recording the fact your content is

617
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,158
ready if you're already calling plane is

618
00:37:11,869 --> 00:37:15,710
notifications arm and search cause
calling play

619
00:37:15,071 --> 00:37:18,090
record that fact inside the completion
handler check for that fact and then

620
00:37:18,009 --> 00:37:20,035
call play

621
00:37:21,016 --> 00:37:24,175
so early the for UI customization

622
00:37:24,319 --> 00:37:27,960
many in aging UI customization topple
the media player controller present

623
00:37:27,096 --> 00:37:29,187
custom controls are present custom UI
rounded

624
00:37:30,087 --> 00:37:33,148
week you that until after we called
handler

625
00:37:34,048 --> 00:37:38,104
the Pierre already has custom UI you
don't interfere with our custom UI

626
00:37:39,004 --> 00:37:42,021
with your own customization that again
going to perform

627
00:37:42,021 --> 00:37:45,028
provider poor experience for users

628
00:37:45,091 --> 00:37:49,250
okay so now we've got that would go back
to our demolition here in a quick demo

629
00:37:50,069 --> 00:37:50,117
setting

630
00:37:50,549 --> 00:37:54,160
that up as well

631
00:37:54,016 --> 00:37:57,038
its cool those him

632
00:37:57,038 --> 00:38:01,052
that hola

633
00:38:01,052 --> 00:38:04,143
quick little demo this as well

634
00:38:05,043 --> 00:38:10,100
run this this is a very simple little
app just provides a few

635
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:16,021
quick little video clips here can click
on a visa and

636
00:38:16,021 --> 00:38:19,038
got a quick video now what I'd like to
do is now that I've got this

637
00:38:19,038 --> 00:38:19,123
video-content

638
00:38:20,023 --> 00:38:24,048
my user id like to engage with I can
monetize this by playing a pre-roll ad

639
00:38:24,048 --> 00:38:28,052
prior to the user actually being able to
view my clips

640
00:38:28,052 --> 00:38:32,065
skirt and quickness and see what we have
to do to get that done

641
00:38:32,065 --> 00:38:35,093
we can star of your the very first thing
to do

642
00:38:35,093 --> 00:38:38,192
is as for dinner specials wanna make
sure that we tell

643
00:38:39,029 --> 00:38:42,940
I had hey I'm gonna be playing career I
it's go fetch them early

644
00:38:42,094 --> 00:38:46,513
start off in our app delegate here

645
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:50,990
and we will import

646
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:55,116
I Adam wimpy import the media player so
we have the perfect classes for APRs

647
00:38:56,016 --> 00:39:00,070
and well go ahead and call repair
pre-roll ads on MTV Movie Player

648
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:03,045
controller once we've done that we need
to actually

649
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:07,026
incall prepare paper Lance so we're
going to our

650
00:39:07,026 --> 00:39:10,030
view controller here which is doing
actual display

651
00:39:10,066 --> 00:39:13,455
and we're going to scroll down to at the
bottom here

652
00:39:14,049 --> 00:39:17,520
collection you did select adamant index
per this is

653
00:39:17,052 --> 00:39:20,110
what happens when you're actually caps
on it at the moment all we're doing is

654
00:39:21,001 --> 00:39:21,086
creating

655
00:39:21,095 --> 00:39:24,424
MP movie player view controller saying
the content URL

656
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:28,370
and then calling present the player to
have to start playing automatically

657
00:39:28,037 --> 00:39:32,075
we wanna sorta interrupt that briefly
and instead we're gonna go ahead and

658
00:39:32,075 --> 00:39:32,151
call

659
00:39:33,051 --> 00:39:37,051
play pre-roll at which completion
handler

660
00:39:37,051 --> 00:39:40,100
and again inside the completion handler
to that that's run a call

661
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,019
and PE the controller the player play

662
00:39:44,019 --> 00:39:47,100
backups top here and ensure that we are

663
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,012
importing I as well so we get the I add
API's available

664
00:39:53,012 --> 00:40:00,012
good save that we can run again

665
00:40:01,077 --> 00:40:04,081
this is where I know it's going to you
want to help you to go in here

666
00:40:05,017 --> 00:40:12,017
make sure that the eye at framework is
linked

667
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,054
out there can we gotta add up

668
00:40:17,054 --> 00:40:20,060
where a ap up here again same

669
00:40:21,014 --> 00:40:25,058
quickly videos we can go ahead and click
on one of these now

670
00:40:25,058 --> 00:40:29,101
and before the video-content actually
play as you see that we've got an iPad

671
00:40:30,001 --> 00:40:33,046
workbench ap at the comes up instead
user can

672
00:40:33,046 --> 00:40:37,091
you this a add content once they're done
with it they can cite

673
00:40:37,091 --> 00:40:40,093
skip had a bit and we owe me it back to
you

674
00:40:40,093 --> 00:40:43,154
the video content for the app itself

675
00:40:44,054 --> 00:40:47,583
and that's pretty much all its involved
in

676
00:40:48,069 --> 00:40:51,148
implementing freerolls what you've
already got a media player content for

677
00:40:51,859 --> 00:40:54,420
their pre role to play in front of

678
00:40:54,042 --> 00:40:57,124
okay so those or the four different
types

679
00:40:58,024 --> 00:41:01,123
I'll ads we have for integration with I
had inside your apt

680
00:41:02,023 --> 00:41:07,106
up what you're using now let's talk a
little about testing

681
00:41:08,006 --> 00:41:12,033
for small their couple things we add
we've added to the developer settings on

682
00:41:12,033 --> 00:41:12,131
the phone

683
00:41:13,031 --> 00:41:17,040
to help you test the integration I it
within your

684
00:41:18,021 --> 00:41:21,106
first you can adjust the story this is

685
00:41:22,006 --> 00:41:26,018
inside the the app's the you have when
you're testing them on the device

686
00:41:26,018 --> 00:41:29,077
you can just how frequently you're going
to get ads as well as you test air

687
00:41:29,077 --> 00:41:29,086
conditions

688
00:41:30,067 --> 00:41:33,096
large test always working additions and
make sure that your app handles those

689
00:41:33,096 --> 00:41:33,174
conditions

690
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:38,141
appropriately in addition you can adjust
the refresh rate

691
00:41:39,041 --> 00:41:42,104
for things like banners and medium racks
this is going to just frequency with

692
00:41:43,004 --> 00:41:43,323
which

693
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:48,230
new ads come in in addition in
combination with the store rain

694
00:41:48,023 --> 00:41:51,104
this allows you to rapidly test error
and non air-conditioned

695
00:41:52,004 --> 00:41:57,076
moving thing on an off-screen

696
00:41:57,076 --> 00:42:00,085
most importantly there's a switch call
hi likely banners

697
00:42:01,066 --> 00:42:04,079
if you're using the can display banner
ads this

698
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:07,398
isn't going to affect enters very much
but this is very important from medium

699
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:08,620
racked

700
00:42:08,062 --> 00:42:12,119
it's very easy to accidentally occlude
part of the medium wracked with some

701
00:42:13,019 --> 00:42:14,358
other UI element

702
00:42:14,529 --> 00:42:18,583
if you do that that's part of the medium
wrecked that may not be seen by User

703
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:22,850
its part in the medium wrecked you that
user may not be able to tap on interact

704
00:42:22,085 --> 00:42:23,089
with

705
00:42:24,025 --> 00:42:27,052
this will the text back you turn on the
highlight clip banners

706
00:42:27,052 --> 00:42:31,331
button we're gonna provide a greener red
overlay over your meeting wrapped

707
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:35,180
or bears are insists that matter that
will show

708
00:42:35,018 --> 00:42:38,064
when the user can actually tap on all
parts this better

709
00:42:38,064 --> 00:42:42,203
when it is officially on-screen
invisible you wanna make sure that any

710
00:42:42,779 --> 00:42:47,808
banners show inside your apt are always
green

711
00:42:48,069 --> 00:42:52,560
remember this only affects your aP's
your developer mode adds

712
00:42:52,056 --> 00:42:55,104
to you run from xrecord and deployed
onto your device

713
00:42:56,004 --> 00:42:59,053
so now you can just store it 0 for all
the other I at

714
00:42:59,089 --> 00:43:04,670
using ap psych advice only affects
developer aP's

715
00:43:04,067 --> 00:43:07,162
okay so that's mine is Asian assert the
first major portion

716
00:43:08,062 --> 00:43:12,081
talk talk next a little bit about
promotion so the other half for the eye

717
00:43:12,081 --> 00:43:13,880
at ecosystem

718
00:43:14,609 --> 00:43:17,970
this is how you can use I add to try
downloads

719
00:43:17,097 --> 00:43:21,195
a your own

720
00:43:22,095 --> 00:43:24,149
so there's three major parts they were
knocked out here for something you

721
00:43:25,049 --> 00:43:25,121
really quick

722
00:43:26,021 --> 00:43:29,054
intro to I at work bench there's another
session on that market

723
00:43:29,054 --> 00:43:32,081
more in detail so it's just a quick
overview and then there are two

724
00:43:32,081 --> 00:43:36,085
new API's they were interesting IOSA one
for ap attribution

725
00:43:37,021 --> 00:43:42,066
and one for app audience sry targeting
talk a little about those new APIs

726
00:43:42,066 --> 00:43:46,071
what sort of the I had workbench was I
had workbench

727
00:43:46,071 --> 00:43:49,135
and workbenches I itself servicing
advertising platform

728
00:43:50,035 --> 00:43:55,038
I especially when app on the Apple dot
com I had work bench that Apple dot com

729
00:43:55,038 --> 00:43:58,063
this is how you can manage being an
advertiser

730
00:43:58,063 --> 00:44:01,146
on at and in create mobile ads

731
00:44:02,046 --> 00:44:06,119
it up later and banners you can use open
templates ignacio I producer

732
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:11,188
to create your own I had assets

733
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:15,080
what you've done that you can use this
chip reach the users who are most likely

734
00:44:15,008 --> 00:44:15,072
to

735
00:44:15,072 --> 00:44:19,094
actually download your app I had isn't
iowa's advertising platform you're going

736
00:44:19,094 --> 00:44:19,175
to reach a whole bunch

737
00:44:20,075 --> 00:44:24,112
users who are on i OS who are already
using our app so I less

738
00:44:25,012 --> 00:44:28,038
nor therefore highly likely to engage
with the ad

739
00:44:28,038 --> 00:44:31,041
but advertising Europe and download ap

740
00:44:31,041 --> 00:44:34,102
you can also manage your campaign
performance here this is where you can

741
00:44:35,002 --> 00:44:35,049
see

742
00:44:35,049 --> 00:44:38,081
how you what senior I had how the
campaign is doing

743
00:44:38,081 --> 00:44:42,086
capture rates Center for your particular
advertising campaign

744
00:44:43,031 --> 00:44:47,123
such workbench again there's any other
session tomorrow kind more detail

745
00:44:48,023 --> 00:44:51,031
next important part talk about SM new AP
as we've got for ap

746
00:44:51,031 --> 00:44:54,113
actual bution K what is that actuation

747
00:44:55,013 --> 00:44:59,065
apparition allows you to track app
downloads up your apt that originated

748
00:44:59,065 --> 00:44:59,129
from

749
00:45:00,029 --> 00:45:04,058
I at its gonna let you measure the
effectiveness

750
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:07,740
love your campaigns you created
workbench that you're running actually

751
00:45:07,074 --> 00:45:13,673
promote your the API's are available at
Iowa 7

752
00:45:14,339 --> 00:45:18,620
are Sarah 7.1 or other and we've
enhanced a little bit and I was

753
00:45:18,062 --> 00:45:21,096
8 as well so that's a new one I'm States

754
00:45:21,096 --> 00:45:24,190
so are the FBI actually look like very
simple genyen include I had

755
00:45:25,009 --> 00:45:28,016
I at that age has everything starts with
for I had

756
00:45:29,006 --> 00:45:33,038
and the recall eighty client shared
client on that in a call lookup

757
00:45:33,092 --> 00:45:36,167
add conversion details

758
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:40,986
inside that you can use the two eights
that are provided completion handler

759
00:45:41,589 --> 00:45:44,960
to determine whether or not this
particular installation

760
00:45:44,096 --> 00:45:47,101
up the app was due to I had

761
00:45:48,001 --> 00:45:51,018
these dates are gonna give you two
things the first is the ap

762
00:45:51,018 --> 00:45:54,087
purchased any the date at which the user
actually made the purchase of this and

763
00:45:54,087 --> 00:45:55,101
and

764
00:45:56,001 --> 00:46:00,039
then the date the impression the date
that the user sawing interacted with the

765
00:46:00,039 --> 00:46:00,083
ad

766
00:46:00,083 --> 00:46:04,572
prior to them purchasing the amp K

767
00:46:05,319 --> 00:46:09,200
if all these dates are there and true
that can indicate you that as far as I

768
00:46:09,002 --> 00:46:09,099
was concerned

769
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:13,936
this was a installation if your app
directly attributable to the user

770
00:46:14,089 --> 00:46:15,000
interacting with

771
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:22,000
seeing eye at promoting your ap

772
00:46:22,063 --> 00:46:25,094
it's very important remember that these
dates are going to be nil

773
00:46:25,094 --> 00:46:28,117
if they're not actually a diode they'll

774
00:46:29,017 --> 00:46:32,166
also be nil if the user has limit ad
tracking so

775
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:36,210
regardless of whether or not this is an
eye at driven insulation

776
00:46:36,021 --> 00:46:39,076
user has the mad at tracking enabled
they don't want their address and data

777
00:46:39,076 --> 00:46:42,117
tract or shown to perhaps

778
00:46:43,017 --> 00:46:45,106
is going to be no we're not gonna give
you this information cases should be

779
00:46:46,006 --> 00:46:47,094
aware that if you're trying to use this
phrase

780
00:46:47,094 --> 00:46:50,139
analytics in addition

781
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:55,045
you want to avoid look up so the stain
on every launch I'll try very tempting

782
00:46:55,045 --> 00:46:57,064
to add this to your apt at Finch
launching

783
00:46:57,064 --> 00:47:00,106
look at conversion detail set some state
flag and do something on every single

784
00:47:01,006 --> 00:47:01,011
launch

785
00:47:01,056 --> 00:47:04,104
ap try to avoid doing there is some
costs you

786
00:47:05,004 --> 00:47:08,010
actually doing this' look up you wanna
for doing this look up to you actually

787
00:47:08,064 --> 00:47:08,137
need to you

788
00:47:09,037 --> 00:47:12,119
and in cash today afterwards

789
00:47:13,019 --> 00:47:16,148
sets after bution the next thing we talk
about

790
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:20,371
is the app audience re targeting APIs is
a new API's IOSA

791
00:47:20,839 --> 00:47:25,210
so what a nap audience regarding again

792
00:47:25,021 --> 00:47:28,070
what is returning allows you to group
the user's a viewer app

793
00:47:28,007 --> 00:47:31,396
that particular audience into various
categories

794
00:47:32,089 --> 00:47:36,137
depending on their activity with in your
app or things you know about them

795
00:47:36,569 --> 00:47:39,740
from their use viewer app

796
00:47:39,074 --> 00:47:42,127
this might be frequent in app purchases
it might be

797
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:46,104
a very high usage rate relative to other
user here

798
00:47:47,004 --> 00:47:50,092
in my pee Dorman users users who use
drop a while ago but you haven't seen in

799
00:47:50,092 --> 00:47:52,681
a while

800
00:47:53,509 --> 00:47:56,536
you can then use this information to
target new ads

801
00:47:56,779 --> 00:47:59,870
you know I workbench directly its
specific subgroups

802
00:47:59,087 --> 00:48:02,144
up your users to reach specific
audiences

803
00:48:03,044 --> 00:48:06,047
within the user's here

804
00:48:06,074 --> 00:48:09,113
each group defines what we call a
segment

805
00:48:09,779 --> 00:48:12,940
thats terminology to talk to the next
couple slides that's important

806
00:48:12,094 --> 00:48:15,263
no a specific group with your users is
that it

807
00:48:16,109 --> 00:48:21,660
with a specific name is a segment

808
00:48:21,066 --> 00:48:25,089
so why would you want to use let's say
your game app developer

809
00:48:25,089 --> 00:48:29,498
you want to promote the new I had
version of your apt to all your iPhone

810
00:48:30,299 --> 00:48:31,060
users

811
00:48:31,006 --> 00:48:34,705
your we go back in reach those specific
user into hey

812
00:48:34,759 --> 00:48:38,690
I've got a great new a iPad version come
try it again

813
00:48:38,069 --> 00:48:42,097
comeback this app if you read out loud

814
00:48:42,097 --> 00:48:45,166
it there's new features that affect
specific subset severe abd you can use

815
00:48:46,066 --> 00:48:48,112
this to reach those specific users

816
00:48:49,012 --> 00:48:52,069
at going to ensure that the as you
create gonna reach precisely the

817
00:48:52,069 --> 00:48:52,133
audience your

818
00:48:53,033 --> 00:48:57,070
tempting target with that

819
00:48:57,007 --> 00:49:00,028
%uh visit similarly you can really good
doormen users to get

820
00:49:00,091 --> 00:49:03,095
users that you haven't seen while you
can craft a message

821
00:49:04,031 --> 00:49:07,052
specifically designed to try to pull
those people back in your apt to

822
00:49:07,052 --> 00:49:08,061
reengage those users may not

823
00:49:09,042 --> 00:49:12,074
strapping sometime

824
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:16,383
if your retail app instead for similar
reasons to use this

825
00:49:17,049 --> 00:49:20,100
you can remind users may have abandoned
a shopping cart your app

826
00:49:20,001 --> 00:49:24,010
segment as in something send them a
message hey you can your shopping cart

827
00:49:24,019 --> 00:49:25,058
maybe should come back and

828
00:49:25,058 --> 00:49:29,093
being ate with this app a few store
purchase those things

829
00:49:29,093 --> 00:49:32,096
if you got loyal customers maybe you
wanna sell a special offer may be onto

830
00:49:32,096 --> 00:49:34,096
something a gift for being a loyal
customer

831
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:37,099
you can't do that with an attitude well
you can reach target specific

832
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:40,198
ads to specific segments users

833
00:49:41,098 --> 00:49:45,137
if they've you grouped customers into
specific categories based on their

834
00:49:46,037 --> 00:49:49,088
previous purchases you can promote sales
based on their previous purchases

835
00:49:49,088 --> 00:49:52,169
all these are done by segmenting those
users and specific groups

836
00:49:53,069 --> 00:49:56,116
and recording that city you can we
engage with those users

837
00:49:57,016 --> 00:50:01,041
specific acts so I was actually work

838
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:04,072
first thing it using on I work engineer
going to create

839
00:50:04,072 --> 00:50:08,083
segments a rest tell I workbench hey I'm
gonna groupie people and

840
00:50:08,083 --> 00:50:12,090
ten different segments please give me
some segment fires to use for that

841
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:15,065
support to notice that you cannot create
segment specific segment identifiers

842
00:50:16,046 --> 00:50:19,905
I workbench doesn't stead and this is
partially for privacy reasons

843
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:23,430
we manage the specific segment
identifiers

844
00:50:23,043 --> 00:50:27,642
once you've done that you doin up to
your app and take avenge the new APIs

845
00:50:28,029 --> 00:50:32,020
you can actually associate specific
segments with specific users

846
00:50:32,002 --> 00:50:36,014
makers at the server so we can actually
record that information

847
00:50:36,014 --> 00:50:39,066
what's that done you go back to at work
bench and you create your

848
00:50:39,066 --> 00:50:43,142
new workbench campaign re target those
customers with some specific

849
00:50:44,042 --> 00:50:47,043
at message okay so

850
00:50:47,043 --> 00:50:51,062
how do you actually do this actually
very simple on the client side

851
00:50:51,062 --> 00:50:55,143
you're going to you include I had you
want to create an array of segments

852
00:50:56,043 --> 00:50:59,138
and these are segments the second
identifiers in which you already gotten

853
00:51:00,038 --> 00:51:01,046
from work bench

854
00:51:01,046 --> 00:51:05,405
you attempt to send random segment evers
attired we're just going to ignore them

855
00:51:05,819 --> 00:51:08,913
make sure you're using the ones already
created and set up inside workbench

856
00:51:09,759 --> 00:51:15,410
so maybe you decided segment a is loyal
users segment be as frequent purchases

857
00:51:15,041 --> 00:51:18,042
and you wanna so she ate the current
user with those two segments

858
00:51:18,042 --> 00:51:21,083
increase segment array with segments in
it

859
00:51:21,083 --> 00:51:24,158
and your call 80 clients your client ad
plant two segments

860
00:51:25,058 --> 00:51:28,061
replace existing I this

861
00:51:28,088 --> 00:51:31,142
is by default would replace existing no
going to add

862
00:51:32,042 --> 00:51:36,066
these segments to the current user if
instead you like to say hey these are

863
00:51:36,066 --> 00:51:38,455
all the segments I'd like to associate
the user

864
00:51:39,049 --> 00:51:42,430
which might also like to remove all
segments user

865
00:51:42,043 --> 00:51:46,052
you can just update that replace
existing yes just completely replace the

866
00:51:46,052 --> 00:51:46,113
old set

867
00:51:47,013 --> 00:51:50,081
with news

868
00:51:50,081 --> 00:51:53,081
okay so thats basically I at

869
00:51:53,081 --> 00:51:56,089
for promotion the new AP as a bat an
eyelid say

870
00:51:56,089 --> 00:51:59,170
so what we learn

871
00:52:00,007 --> 00:52:03,626
for solar some best practices for using
I had reporter notes banners

872
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:08,730
we've doctor for not sad to talk about
as a banner there's interstitial

873
00:52:08,073 --> 00:52:13,099
as a medium racked and as a pre-roll
they all have their place

874
00:52:13,099 --> 00:52:16,150
take revenge the different ad formats
that we've given to you

875
00:52:17,005 --> 00:52:20,023
think about where they belong in your
out and

876
00:52:20,068 --> 00:52:24,092
make sure you use the appropriate at for
the appropriate contacts

877
00:52:24,092 --> 00:52:27,147
as part of that consider the user when
you're placing thats yes

878
00:52:28,047 --> 00:52:32,876
ads are very valuable for generating
revenue from your apt I had can help a

879
00:52:33,299 --> 00:52:34,310
lot pitting

880
00:52:34,031 --> 00:52:37,106
but great revenue in great app star

881
00:52:38,006 --> 00:52:41,068
with great users well your own alienate
all users

882
00:52:41,068 --> 00:52:44,187
by horror ad placement but poor adchoice

883
00:52:44,799 --> 00:52:47,920
you're not actually going to happen that
way you want

884
00:52:47,092 --> 00:52:50,165
really make sure you hear center focus
to where you're picking

885
00:52:51,065 --> 00:52:54,504
to put ads whichever actor choosing to
put their

886
00:52:55,089 --> 00:52:59,220
in addition

887
00:52:59,022 --> 00:53:03,029
there's a cycle here between
monetization and promotion

888
00:53:03,029 --> 00:53:06,087
K optimize your ads performance to begin
your

889
00:53:06,087 --> 00:53:10,098
ap sad performance to begin with that's
going to generate revenue from it

890
00:53:10,098 --> 00:53:13,172
but don't forget to take a measured by
workbench and really promote your app

891
00:53:14,072 --> 00:53:17,160
it's important to continue to get new
users for your app if you wanna continue

892
00:53:18,006 --> 00:53:19,015
get revenues

893
00:53:19,609 --> 00:53:23,390
from here but to feed into each other
you want to generate revenue

894
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:26,040
you want Spencer your event re
advertiser Apple acquired

895
00:53:26,004 --> 00:53:29,032
users them

896
00:53:29,068 --> 00:53:34,077
this is our best practices for a for
more information me on this

897
00:53:34,077 --> 00:53:37,133
we've got mark loser I had technologies
evangelist you can reach him

898
00:53:38,033 --> 00:53:41,110
the email address Paul I had programming
guide online /a

899
00:53:42,001 --> 00:53:45,003
it with along with the rest to the IRS
SDK developer

900
00:53:45,012 --> 00:53:48,110
information there's some Apple Developer
forms we monitor

901
00:53:49,001 --> 00:53:53,006
you've got questions UN other developers
and us will be modernised answer

902
00:53:53,015 --> 00:53:53,077
questions

903
00:53:53,077 --> 00:53:57,085
hopefully help you out a couple related
sessions here

904
00:53:57,085 --> 00:54:00,140
ODBC unfortunately remiss the new iTunes
Connect which sucked a little bit about

905
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:01,713
I add

906
00:54:02,109 --> 00:54:06,330

video tomorrow morning at nine in Nob

907

Hill is what's new in I had work bench
was going going to a little bit more

908
00:54:09,049 --> 00:54:09,147
detail about the

909
00:54:10,047 --> 00:54:13,083
actor bution in the audience segment
retarding that I talked about

910
