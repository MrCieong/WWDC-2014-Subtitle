1
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:20,052
everybody good morning my name is Rachel
Roth then

2
00:00:20,052 --> 00:00:23,053
I'm wanna Apple's user experience
evangelists

3
00:00:23,062 --> 00:00:26,097
now the SSN is not

4
00:00:26,097 --> 00:00:29,178
about monetizing about having

5
00:00:30,078 --> 00:00:33,089
a great experience with an aperture says

6
00:00:33,089 --> 00:00:37,117
because a great experience is what's
going to keep people coming back here

7
00:00:38,017 --> 00:00:38,110
after game

8
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:44,069
time and time and time again thing about
the last time you had a really fantastic

9
00:00:44,078 --> 00:00:45,175
me on a great restaurant

10
00:00:46,075 --> 00:00:49,076
for its price you always want to come
back to write

11
00:00:49,085 --> 00:00:52,157
for this is the bigger picture

12
00:00:53,057 --> 00:00:57,139
have what it takes to have a great
experience with an aperture says and

13
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:01,128
today fashion is all based on the
assumption

14
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:04,780
that you already have a really amazing
ap

15
00:01:04,078 --> 00:01:08,160
our game your app meets the needs of
your ID and

16
00:01:09,006 --> 00:01:12,065
it's got a really intuitive interfaces
I'm

17
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:17,450
executed really well for game it's just
fun to play

18
00:01:17,045 --> 00:01:21,047
an earth really know design secrets are
shortcuts around a fun

19
00:01:21,065 --> 00:01:24,139
but I know that you guys all have a
handoff so we don't have to do well on

20
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:26,041
that for too long

21
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:30,138
now if you're using the free me mr. the
pay me a model with an app purchase

22
00:01:31,038 --> 00:01:34,056
fares its so important that people can

23
00:01:34,056 --> 00:01:37,087
enjoy our game without buying anything

24
00:01:37,087 --> 00:01:40,120
I mean I think most of us are happy
experience you

25
00:01:41,002 --> 00:01:44,064
get a new app from the App Store and you
download it launch it

26
00:01:44,082 --> 00:01:48,158
only to find that you can't do anything
with it that's frustrating

27
00:01:49,058 --> 00:01:52,097
need to make a purchase in order to get
from you carry out a bit

28
00:01:52,097 --> 00:01:55,149
would be like if you bought mixer

29
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:59,123
for your kitchen and it didn't come with
any attachments you can miss any

30
00:02:00,023 --> 00:02:03,075
mix anything be really disappointing

31
00:02:03,075 --> 00:02:08,128
not fly mixers come with the basic
attachment that you can use said nixon

32
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:10,567
see how great the mixer and

33
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:14,360
and many by some additional attachments
for specialty

34
00:02:14,036 --> 00:02:17,093
tasks like making bratter some kinda
pastry

35
00:02:17,093 --> 00:02:21,164
and that's where you want it she with
your axe you wanna let people really

36
00:02:22,064 --> 00:02:25,072
enjoyed the functionality and utility

37
00:02:25,072 --> 00:02:30,111
quality a wrap and then you offer them
advantages or

38
00:02:31,011 --> 00:02:34,076
additional functionality them advanced
features

39
00:02:34,076 --> 00:02:39,088
when you offer those things you wanna
make sure that you make buying easy

40
00:02:39,088 --> 00:02:43,146
I know this probably sounds obvious but
I'm not just talking about

41
00:02:44,046 --> 00:02:47,142
sending a transaction for the App Store
getting a response back

42
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:51,066
you want to make sure that the decision
to buy something

43
00:02:51,066 --> 00:02:54,090
is really easy for the people coming
here after game

44
00:02:54,009 --> 00:03:00,025
there's a lot of friction to making that
decision to buy

45
00:03:01,006 --> 00:03:06,034
and a lot of it if outside your control
but as app developers you wanna

46
00:03:06,034 --> 00:03:06,091
eliminate

47
00:03:06,091 --> 00:03:09,138
any obstacle to making that decision to
purchase something

48
00:03:10,038 --> 00:03:13,065
inside iraq make easiest possible

49
00:03:13,065 --> 00:03:16,133
that decision to buy that fleeting
moment and there's

50
00:03:17,033 --> 00:03:22,077
many traps so one of the best things
that you can do

51
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:27,104
its integrate your merchandise and the
experience many people are gonna buy

52
00:03:28,004 --> 00:03:30,030
things if they don't know what you're
offering

53
00:03:30,003 --> 00:03:34,412
they can't see them talks a lot of
developers to

54
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:38,180
create a really great store section
insider there after game and then

55
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:40,089
they're really disappointed because no
one's going there

56
00:03:40,089 --> 00:03:43,166
not buying anything ask if people know
what you're offering

57
00:03:44,066 --> 00:03:48,111
kinda like a difference if I fad you
wanna buy something

58
00:03:49,011 --> 00:03:53,077
fad how much like a really great drawing
tool

59
00:03:53,077 --> 00:03:57,086
and and that's what you want to help
explain with a rap by putting the

60
00:03:58,067 --> 00:03:59,128
merchandise out on display

61
00:04:00,028 --> 00:04:04,097
integrating it into the experience when
you're doing that

62
00:04:04,097 --> 00:04:07,101
I'm not suggesting that you become a
pretty self percent

63
00:04:08,037 --> 00:04:11,095
about an nobody wants the sky following
them around

64
00:04:11,095 --> 00:04:14,169
saying hey you wanna buy something hey
hey hey you wanna buy something

65
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:18,078
do you want to buy something to you want
to buy something every minute and that's

66
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:23,059
where you're risking if you're flashing
a lot of alert for notifications are

67
00:04:23,059 --> 00:04:26,098
crazy animations to try and high-speed
contracts or

68
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:29,661
it's really about timing

69
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:32,990
and with some ap stats about

70
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:36,107
offering the right thing at the right
time like at a restaurant when the

71
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:38,105
waiter brings you

72
00:04:39,005 --> 00:04:43,038
the dessert menu at the end of the mail
I mean you may not even want to for

73
00:04:43,038 --> 00:04:46,113
right back it doesn't property that they
offered it

74
00:04:47,013 --> 00:04:50,106
it would feel percy if they offered it
to you before he sat down

75
00:04:51,006 --> 00:04:54,024
and why reading your appetizer

76
00:04:54,024 --> 00:04:57,113
fear I think about what's the right
moment to offer something to someone

77
00:04:58,013 --> 00:05:01,046
and do it in a way that's really
thoughtful

78
00:05:01,046 --> 00:05:05,094
now with other absence about a
presentation

79
00:05:05,094 --> 00:05:09,105
you I think about a really great window
display first store

80
00:05:10,005 --> 00:05:13,076
I happened to be very partial to the
Apple Retail window display

81
00:05:13,076 --> 00:05:16,081
sure I'll come as no surprise to you
guys

82
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:21,051
now they do a great job showing off the
merchandise and Ron you ran

83
00:05:21,051 --> 00:05:25,088
makes you want to find out more about
the product really intriguing

84
00:05:25,088 --> 00:05:28,116
and that's what you want to think about
whether after your game

85
00:05:29,016 --> 00:05:34,024
you wanna integrate the merchandise in a
way that feels really natural

86
00:05:34,096 --> 00:05:38,162
missus paper by 53 it's an Apple Design
Award winner from years ago

87
00:05:39,062 --> 00:05:42,149
that is still a fantastic example
integrating

88
00:05:43,049 --> 00:05:47,097
in app purchases into their experience
have you ever used at

89
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:52,176
app is designed to capture ideas through
scat shares and diagrams and no

90
00:05:53,076 --> 00:05:56,985
and like that makes Turner catch and
they give you some basic drawing tools

91
00:05:57,669 --> 00:05:59,030
for free

92
00:05:59,003 --> 00:06:05,452
your pen and eraser you can see from
this example you can do to hands with it

93
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:09,000
but there may be occasions when you need
a more advanced trying for a different

94
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,083
kind of

95
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:13,091
liner texture and so that's why these
leave these empty spots here

96
00:06:14,063 --> 00:06:19,122
where the restaurant Ross ago and that's
like that window display in a store

97
00:06:20,022 --> 00:06:25,047
its putting them out for you see there's
no question what's available

98
00:06:25,047 --> 00:06:28,131
what they didn't dare and Hyde
everything an art supply store

99
00:06:29,031 --> 00:06:33,086
or attacking a pencil case but then you
to go push open to see what's available

100
00:06:33,086 --> 00:06:36,158
that's creating friction at expecting
the player that

101
00:06:37,058 --> 00:06:41,066
your audience to do work to see what
there

102
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:45,135
and another thing that they didn't do
its trick you into thinking that you

103
00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:46,780
already own Dhabi

104
00:06:46,078 --> 00:06:50,135
of because if you could see them all
then when you tap don't want to use it

105
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:55,074
it holds you the you paid money just to
test out a brass

106
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:59,000
well that would be disappointing at nog
that sa great experience

107
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,024
frustrating on and that's why this
design is

108
00:07:03,024 --> 00:07:06,093
so al again and so great it's
informative

109
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:09,642
but it's not percy

110
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,110
known except let's look at that timing I
mentioned earlier totally different

111
00:07:14,011 --> 00:07:14,096
kinda crap

112
00:07:14,096 --> 00:07:18,137
Bloomberg Businessweek and this is a
business publication i has regular

113
00:07:19,037 --> 00:07:19,105
updates

114
00:07:20,005 --> 00:07:24,012
new content and without a subscription
you can still browse

115
00:07:24,075 --> 00:07:30,081
read several articles browse all the
headlines in the introductory census

116
00:07:31,035 --> 00:07:35,082
now if you tap on something that
requires a subscription

117
00:07:35,082 --> 00:07:39,431
they bring up the subscription options
fight the dessert menu

118
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:44,169
you're interested in reading some other
content cell here

119
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:49,530
here's the information about
subscription see you can get it

120
00:07:49,053 --> 00:07:53,192
for preventing it right at that perfect
moment

121
00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:58,130
they're making it easy for you to get
the subscription

122
00:07:58,013 --> 00:08:01,112
now they also have this subscribe button
down here in the corner

123
00:08:02,012 --> 00:08:05,068
every screen and that's great you

124
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:08,105
but having that in addition to the
integrated method

125
00:08:09,005 --> 00:08:14,016
have some reach more people for nothing
you can't have a store section

126
00:08:14,016 --> 00:08:17,065
you just don't wanna make it up only
place that people can find

127
00:08:17,065 --> 00:08:20,066
what you're offering

128
00:08:20,075 --> 00:08:24,158
now this also works for games I don't
know how many have you played smash at

129
00:08:25,058 --> 00:08:28,065
its relief an arcade game that involves
smashing things

130
00:08:29,028 --> 00:08:33,817
as you might have guessed very
satisfying after a long day

131
00:08:34,069 --> 00:08:37,164
the way that it works is back at the
arcade game and the more accurate you

132
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:39,025
are smashing things

133
00:08:39,079 --> 00:08:41,137
the further you're gonna get you
progress through the checkpoints and

134
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:42,738
mocking them

135
00:08:43,449 --> 00:08:46,481
and they also offer premium percent and
they have a great way of illustrating

136
00:08:46,769 --> 00:08:48,370
exactly what that

137
00:08:48,037 --> 00:08:52,055
via featured as 30 I'll

138
00:08:52,055 --> 00:08:54,152
so here we are let's start from
checkpoint here maybe I can get a little

139
00:08:55,052 --> 00:08:56,561
bit further this time

140
00:08:57,029 --> 00:09:01,390
it good

141
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:04,075
avatar for pars the pre members and I'm
not ready to buy it

142
00:09:04,075 --> 00:09:07,152
wide

143
00:09:08,052 --> 00:09:12,085
pretty compelling right I mean if you
had any doubt about what advantage is

144
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:13,142
that they're offering

145
00:09:14,042 --> 00:09:17,077
that spells it out for you right away

146
00:09:17,077 --> 00:09:19,083
now I don't know how many have you
noticed that there's also this get

147
00:09:20,037 --> 00:09:23,116
premium button here in the corner

148
00:09:24,016 --> 00:09:28,695
and if you did would you guess that's
what the pre members and Matt

149
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:32,620
I mean summer view might have might have
tapped on its fine out and and family

150
00:09:32,062 --> 00:09:34,091
may not have

151
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:37,649
and they have the details here about
what you get

152
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:40,654
but having this in addition to that
integrated math said

153
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:46,149
it's just much more fact there
explaining what the featured ads for you

154
00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:51,190
an offering it to you at the time that
you can use that

155
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:54,094
23 member don't be that guy

156
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:57,113
nobody wants some one person in your
face

157
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:03,360
hectoring pestering people have not
going to get the results that you want

158
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:08,111
but powerful integration the merchandise
well

159
00:10:09,011 --> 00:10:13,430
now another challenge is to help people
understand the value why you're offering

160
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:17,620
and FB if you walk into a clothing store
this is easy to figure out

161
00:10:17,062 --> 00:10:21,094
you can touch the merchandise feel feel
with the fabric feels like

162
00:10:21,094 --> 00:10:25,112
the filler luxurious for viagra cheap

163
00:10:26,012 --> 00:10:29,017
the well-made seems following part

164
00:10:29,017 --> 00:10:34,024
most importantly doesn't fit you look
good is it gonna see your purpose there

165
00:10:34,087 --> 00:10:38,095
so letting people try all merchandise
before they buy it is a really effective

166
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:38,179
way

167
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:42,097
helping them understand the quality and
the value

168
00:10:42,097 --> 00:10:45,836
and utility what you're offering

169
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:49,778
me when buy a car without taking it for
a test drive first

170
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,440
right the same principle

171
00:10:53,044 --> 00:10:56,079
letting people use that will be the best
way for them to understand

172
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:02,628
how often they are again paper by 53
does a great job with that

173
00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:06,700
in addition to providing a lot of FAM
Paul about that

174
00:11:06,007 --> 00:11:09,084
what the tools are capable %ah they put
together an entire Journal

175
00:11:10,047 --> 00:11:14,130
made by their staff showing of the
different tools in their capabilities

176
00:11:15,003 --> 00:11:20,056
and of course they let you use the tools
the basic tools for free

177
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:24,092
every you have to use this topic and how
you patrols respond beautifully to your

178
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:27,010
finger

179
00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:31,018
now me telling you that isn't nearly as
effective as you actually using the app

180
00:11:31,018 --> 00:11:32,100
and so that's why

181
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,019
when you go to find out about these
advanced drawing tools they let you test

182
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:38,110
out right there

183
00:11:38,011 --> 00:11:41,016
you've got the sketch pads along with
detailed information

184
00:11:41,061 --> 00:11:45,113
and testing them out as is how you can
determine the quality and the utility

185
00:11:46,013 --> 00:11:50,076
work i text Saturday provide how their
acts your finger when you're trying

186
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:54,083
which one is going to be right for what
you're trying to achieve

187
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:58,124
and each of the sketchpad have strong
already in progress

188
00:11:59,024 --> 00:12:02,069
kinda like a test drive where they
taking on certain roads to show you how

189
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:03,168
well the car handles

190
00:12:04,068 --> 00:12:07,101
paper by fifty three-a setting up the
sketch pads to show you

191
00:12:08,001 --> 00:12:11,086
optimal use their service and suggested
uses for this trough

192
00:12:11,086 --> 00:12:15,112
it runs great watercolors they've set up
a watercolor trying for you so then

193
00:12:16,012 --> 00:12:21,105
you can jump and then an ad on earth try
your own drinks

194
00:12:22,005 --> 00:12:25,664
and it might seem obvious to take this
approach for drying trough but I promise

195
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:26,800
that will work for almost

196
00:12:26,008 --> 00:12:31,079
any controversial ban here's a really
different example on that line

197
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:38,055
that it's a popular messaging app you
can send and receive messages for free

198
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:41,170
now one of the things that
differentiates line from its competitors

199
00:12:42,007 --> 00:12:46,024
is the vast array of stickers but they
offer

200
00:12:46,087 --> 00:12:49,093
figures are kinda like really crazy
emoji

201
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:53,656
you can include in your messages and
send it back for their frantic

202
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,440
it gives your your text messages home
life

203
00:12:57,044 --> 00:13:00,141
now line gives you a very generous fax
and have the stickers for free

204
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:04,050
you can't right now plus the ability to
earn

205
00:13:04,005 --> 00:13:08,534
sicker without paying anything are you
have to do with that Hello Kitty is a

206
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:11,097
friends and then you get Hello Kitty
stickers

207
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:16,734
some people love Hello Kitty stickers
sir

208
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:21,800
and using them really helps me
understand how great they are

209
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:25,065
now another thing that they offer our
beam and when I first investigative

210
00:13:26,037 --> 00:13:29,066
teams I'll be honest I have no idea what
extraction

211
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:33,620
I thought oh great are some free ones
let me try out the brown bear

212
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:36,971
have see what happened here so when you
choose the brown bear

213
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:40,604
theme and forgetting the standard you
are you can

214
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,347
bears her a everywhere all over the
propane

215
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:49,190
even the tab bar icon for rare

216
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:52,858
now sure they can refer to description
what if the man is there even a

217
00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:56,122
screenshot but that wouldn't have been
nearly as effective at combating

218
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,220
what happens when you use the theme
giving preview of some free ones to try

219
00:14:01,022 --> 00:14:02,086
out of the bath way

220
00:14:02,086 --> 00:14:06,161
to really understand what they're all
about

221
00:14:07,061 --> 00:14:10,068
and that's worked for publication to
anyone have any question about where to

222
00:14:11,031 --> 00:14:12,610
get the free preview content

223
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:18,000
on the screen they've made it really
easy for everybody

224
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,002
Esquire magazine wants to make sure that
you now

225
00:14:21,002 --> 00:14:24,067
that reading their content on an iPad is
the bath experience

226
00:14:24,085 --> 00:14:27,116
of law and so they give you free free
content

227
00:14:28,016 --> 00:14:31,070
check out it's got videos interactivity

228
00:14:31,007 --> 00:14:34,446
and this is the equivalent to standing
in line at the store and flipping

229
00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:36,540
through a magazine or

230
00:14:36,054 --> 00:14:39,283
going to comic store in checking out
artwork

231
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:42,781
I have to really know whether the
reading experience is going to be good

232
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:48,500
and whether the contents going to be
something that you're interested in

233
00:14:48,005 --> 00:14:51,059
and again this also works for games

234
00:14:52,004 --> 00:14:55,073
now I'm pretty sure that everyone in
this room have played candy crush saga

235
00:14:55,073 --> 00:14:59,111
at some point but for the two Vera
haven't it's a puzzle game

236
00:15:00,011 --> 00:15:03,079
and and Bay they've done OK with an app
purchases

237
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:06,151
you know and tho what they do at the
beginning of every levels that they

238
00:15:07,051 --> 00:15:09,620
offer you these boosters

239
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,440
and these losers give you a leg up on
completing the task

240
00:15:13,044 --> 00:15:17,067
and they become much more valuable that
the harder the puzzle ass

241
00:15:17,067 --> 00:15:21,536
nephew never use on you can just ignore
them go for that big pin play button and

242
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:25,500
endurance for puzzle game

243
00:15:25,005 --> 00:15:28,066
so that's why they introduced the day we
do sir we are

244
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:32,011
every day you can come and get one of
their booster

245
00:15:32,011 --> 00:15:36,030
for free so there is nothing at standing
in the way

246
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:40,092
you trying them out and once you try
them out you really know what a

247
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:44,050
difference that they can make

248
00:15:44,005 --> 00:15:47,049
so that's what I mean about offering a
test drive

249
00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:50,148
letting someone really experienced that
merchandise trying it out before they

250
00:15:51,048 --> 00:15:51,142
buy

251
00:15:52,042 --> 00:15:56,063
is the best way to communicate the value
and the youthfulness

252
00:15:56,063 --> 00:15:59,892
and the quality and that's why it's
gonna make them

253
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:05,534
decision to buy something easier on
people

254
00:16:06,209 --> 00:16:09,630
now another way to reduce the friction
to buying as to

255
00:16:09,063 --> 00:16:14,079
sick with your theme it's really
important that every screen in your ass

256
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,085
or your game

257
00:16:15,085 --> 00:16:20,014
is cohesive and you want to carry that
visual design all the way through

258
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:24,320
that interaction model needs to be
consistent

259
00:16:24,032 --> 00:16:28,111
and you wanna put as much effort and
time and designing the screams as you

260
00:16:29,011 --> 00:16:32,980
anything else in your app for your game

261
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:37,820
so this is Russell adventure and it's
got hundreds level the puzzle games and

262
00:16:37,082 --> 00:16:37,166
all these various

263
00:16:38,066 --> 00:16:41,160
see more of you start out in the 4s

264
00:16:42,006 --> 00:16:45,008
any work for the different puzzles in
the fourth to get to

265
00:16:45,008 --> 00:16:49,053
other lands now every aspect of the
forest

266
00:16:50,025 --> 00:16:54,051
looks like the forests they've got
doesn't matter the objective of the game

267
00:16:54,051 --> 00:16:59,125
you can see the fourth details creeping
in at every corner

268
00:17:00,025 --> 00:17:03,041
now there in our purchases involved in
our currency

269
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:06,530
which you can use sedan by advantages

270
00:17:06,899 --> 00:17:09,913
for the different level of powerful beer

271
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:14,117
and you can earn in our currency as
you're playing but you can of course

272
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:18,130
make an aperture further and a current
fame

273
00:17:18,013 --> 00:17:22,502
so imagine you're up against Chief
smarty pants here and he's tough

274
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:26,621
so it might be worth getting some in our
currency so that you can

275
00:17:26,639 --> 00:17:31,190
so that go buy some in our current be
seen it from his ministers

276
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:34,888
so mad then you're excited you want to
be chief smarty pants

277
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:38,080
that the next thing you thought was best

278
00:17:38,008 --> 00:17:41,070
it would be terrible right having family
there's that

279
00:17:41,007 --> 00:17:44,045
entirely different you either you have
to understand

280
00:17:45,008 --> 00:17:48,087
you to think about it its release
sterile looking

281
00:17:48,159 --> 00:17:54,950
not very well laid out stage right now
the experience how the forest anymore

282
00:17:54,095 --> 00:17:58,074
and that creates friction makes it feel
more like work

283
00:17:58,929 --> 00:18:01,954
that's making it harder to buy something
now

284
00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:05,960
thank for a travel ban sir does not do
that I

285
00:18:05,096 --> 00:18:08,144
they have a nice fourth fame purchasing
experience than all the

286
00:18:09,044 --> 00:18:15,663
visual design and enter access concerts
at everything else in the game

287
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:20,830
so make sure that you maintain the world
love your game or the look at your apt

288
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:20,110
on

289
00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:24,085
everything else crane and with
everything ok control

290
00:18:24,094 --> 00:18:27,833
because many families snatch people I
know that we're all

291
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:31,690
and they have to deal with the new
interface our new look it's gonna feel

292
00:18:31,789 --> 00:18:32,837
like work

293
00:18:33,269 --> 00:18:38,278
and from the heart and buying we want it
to be easy right

294
00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:42,245
add to the word of warning while you are
busy sticking with your theme

295
00:18:42,929 --> 00:18:46,003
don't take it so far that language
becomes confusing

296
00:18:46,669 --> 00:18:49,713
you want to make sure that people can
really understand exactly where they're

297
00:18:50,109 --> 00:18:51,190
gonna be getting for their money

298
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,920
use clear language now I have you guys
ever seen a description for an apartment

299
00:18:57,019 --> 00:18:59,033
or house that said something like

300
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:02,163
needs a little work and many show up in
its

301
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,592
now looks more like this

302
00:19:05,889 --> 00:19:09,974
I think we've all had it for him now
with any purchase that so important to

303
00:19:10,739 --> 00:19:10,831
be honest

304
00:19:11,659 --> 00:19:14,745
at there's really a fine line between
try to be positive about something

305
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:17,541
highlighting the features and really
being

306
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:20,781
overly optimistic about why you're
selling nobody

307
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:25,191
nobody wants to be disappointed when
they see what the merchandise actually

308
00:19:25,479 --> 00:19:27,460
yes

309
00:19:27,046 --> 00:19:30,315
and especially when you're coming to
subscription Anzar

310
00:19:30,729 --> 00:19:34,792
recurring contact you want to be as
specific as possible

311
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:38,440
set people's expectations crackling

312
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:41,373
when are they gonna get new content how
much content are they getting for the

313
00:19:41,769 --> 00:19:42,798
price

314
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:47,146
maybe 25 something like this you know
now is that ok sam se

315
00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:51,967
or is it a bargain I mean if its 12
issues than a year

316
00:19:52,309 --> 00:19:56,368
less than a dollar an issue that that's
pretty reasonable right

317
00:19:56,899 --> 00:19:59,923
points here issues as well

318
00:20:00,139 --> 00:20:04,080
I don't now in fact content really worth
that much money me and see now I'm of

319
00:20:04,008 --> 00:20:07,717
thinking about whether or not this is a
purchase I wanna make

320
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:12,200
and set up quickly coming to a decision
getting the new contact going off to

321
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:12,721
enjoy it

322
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:16,995
because that's what I've come to an apt
to do come to enjoy contact have come to

323
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:18,830
nap to help me achieve

324
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:22,672
happening Jamie Oliver does a much
better job with Beth

325
00:20:23,419 --> 00:20:27,424
I he's a famous staff and he has a
recipes app

326
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,330
and you'll see here that here they'd let
you know that new contact is coming on

327
00:20:32,033 --> 00:20:33,632
the FAC and Wednesday

328
00:20:33,929 --> 00:20:36,948
every month crystal-clear

329
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:42,135
very a setback I know exactly went
extracting

330
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:46,294
fit star is a personal training
application

331
00:20:46,429 --> 00:20:51,453
and they have a number workout and their
tailored to your goals and also your

332
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:51,742
actual

333
00:20:52,399 --> 00:20:56,448
performance now they're subscription
screen gives you

334
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:59,903
detailed outline some of the programs I
mean

335
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:03,077
you can find out the length of the
workout you want something short

336
00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:06,517
do you want something long they're
offering bout for that

337
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:10,353
the advantages them are you interested
in fat burner

338
00:21:10,749 --> 00:21:14,090
are trying to do strength training

339
00:21:14,009 --> 00:21:17,046
they've even point out which one is
recommended for me based on a couple

340
00:21:17,046 --> 00:21:20,515
questions I answered earlier

341
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:24,320
and when you're ready to buy not from
scripts am

342
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:28,047
that screen is so clear about exactly
what you're going to be getting

343
00:21:28,047 --> 00:21:31,856
I love the program's unlimited free down
there

344
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:37,320
maybe even highlighted the annual
subscription with a discount

345
00:21:37,032 --> 00:21:41,094
they've made it so easy just through the
use of clear language

346
00:21:41,094 --> 00:21:44,109
for me to make a decision about buying
something

347
00:21:45,009 --> 00:21:48,148
and now I really understand what I'm
going for my money and I can appreciate

348
00:21:48,229 --> 00:21:51,248
it

349
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:54,720
now another way that you can make this
clear to your audience is to

350
00:21:54,072 --> 00:21:57,711
do the math for them I don't like doing
math

351
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:01,960
that's not that's not fun for me don't
make me do the math

352
00:22:01,096 --> 00:22:06,295
it's your job as the app developer make
it easy on people to make a decision

353
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,256
so quick which one of these is the best
I am

354
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:15,090
I mean I'm sure some love you can very
quickly calculate best that most people

355
00:22:15,009 --> 00:22:16,084
are not going to want you

356
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:19,153
it's the fun part hi and

357
00:22:19,909 --> 00:22:23,460
and so that's why you really want to
help people understand which is going to

358
00:22:23,046 --> 00:22:26,445
be the most cost effective for them

359
00:22:26,859 --> 00:22:29,872
this is love you if they're dating
application and and

360
00:22:29,989 --> 00:22:33,690
they offered 100 utility without a
subscription and you can

361
00:22:33,069 --> 00:22:36,069
fill out a profile method users

362
00:22:36,069 --> 00:22:40,158
there's lots of ways to browse essential
suitors including this is our radar

363
00:22:40,779 --> 00:22:41,851
screen of what you're seeing here

364
00:22:42,499 --> 00:22:46,536
see all the people of potential dates
around me

365
00:22:46,869 --> 00:22:49,921
and of course they have from premium
premium feature

366
00:22:50,389 --> 00:22:53,820
a happy get more exposure to people

367
00:22:53,082 --> 00:22:58,031
and here is how they explain the
subscription options

368
00:22:58,769 --> 00:23:01,846
for that pennies a day to find love

369
00:23:02,539 --> 00:23:05,620
pennies a day to find have who can
afford pennies today

370
00:23:06,349 --> 00:23:10,444
for lap now there's no gaffer care I
know exactly which

371
00:23:11,299 --> 00:23:14,830
which subscription is gonna be the
lowest cost per day

372
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:17,532
but time porn if your gonna take it to
this level

373
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:21,317
and make sure that you're so calling out
the total purchase price

374
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:25,320
because again we want to be honest and
clear with our language

375
00:23:25,032 --> 00:23:28,561
people are going to want to know what
what they expect to pay don't make them

376
00:23:28,849 --> 00:23:29,870
do the math in reverse

377
00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:35,131
right now if you're available worldwide
I wanna make sure that you localize your

378
00:23:35,779 --> 00:23:36,792
currency

379
00:23:36,909 --> 00:23:40,993
combat the huge roadblock if you down

380
00:23:41,749 --> 00:23:45,798
so that's what I mean about about doing
the math for people it can be so helpful

381
00:23:46,239 --> 00:23:50,570
in making that decision quickly

382
00:23:50,057 --> 00:23:53,836
now another thing that's really helpful
as showing fewer thing

383
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:57,400
it's about quality not about quantity

384
00:23:57,859 --> 00:24:01,870
too many choices you risk overwhelming
people

385
00:24:01,969 --> 00:24:04,986
and I don't know how many have you heard
the paradox of choice

386
00:24:05,139 --> 00:24:08,570
ineffectual means that the more choices
that you have

387
00:24:08,057 --> 00:24:11,071
the harder it is to make a decision

388
00:24:11,071 --> 00:24:14,360
and in fact when you too many choices
that choice over loud

389
00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:19,190
its stresses you out and what you people
wind up doing is avoiding making a

390
00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:21,019
decision of together

391
00:24:21,019 --> 00:24:25,928
and you want people to make a decision
to purchase something

392
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:30,115
kind of like if you've ever gone to make
our recipe and it calls for

393
00:24:30,259 --> 00:24:35,271
Apple of major making apple pie and so
you got your last year the grocery store

394
00:24:35,379 --> 00:24:37,840
and then you're faced with death

395
00:24:37,084 --> 00:24:40,753
well kinda crap all is it called in to
listen yes sir

396
00:24:41,509 --> 00:24:44,537
rad USSR fuji here Pink Lady

397
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:47,816
year our it's too much it's overwhelming

398
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:54,710
too many of our and the four runs on you
just abandoning map high all together

399
00:24:54,071 --> 00:24:58,410
you want to avoid that reaction in your
app too many choices become

400
00:24:59,049 --> 00:25:02,061
stressful and that's going to result in
people

401
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:06,193
avoiding a purchase decision are
together

402
00:25:06,409 --> 00:25:09,416
fair here maps it for different dating
application

403
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:14,210
again loads are you tell me where after
scripts an more than

404
00:25:14,021 --> 00:25:18,110

406
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:24,979
including recommended partner

407
00:25:24,979 --> 00:25:28,986
they do offer some premium premium
features that allow and one other things

408
00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:29,122
are seeing

409
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:33,960
who's viewed me Sarah tapping on that
viewed me baton

410
00:25:33,096 --> 00:25:37,395
brings up their subscription choices so
they're offering me that information at

411
00:25:38,259 --> 00:25:40,283
the time that I need it

412
00:25:40,499 --> 00:25:43,542
now look I've got three easy choices
here

413
00:25:43,929 --> 00:25:47,930
maybe even highlighted the one at the
best value

414
00:25:48,029 --> 00:25:51,043
three choices as an easy decisions Frank

415
00:25:51,169 --> 00:25:56,174
I don't have to for all for a long last
have options are paged through screen

416
00:25:56,219 --> 00:25:59,210
after screen with different subscription
numbers on it

417
00:25:59,021 --> 00:26:02,033
and I have to remember them in my head
and try and figure out that makes it

418
00:26:02,033 --> 00:26:04,072
hard

419
00:26:04,369 --> 00:26:08,381
buying things shouldn't be hard so fewer
thing

420
00:26:08,489 --> 00:26:11,514
all on one screen no paging no scrolling

421
00:26:11,739 --> 00:26:18,739
people want to be able to see all other
options at once

422
00:26:19,389 --> 00:26:23,403
now if someone's ready to make an impact
that decision to buy they're ready to

423
00:26:23,529 --> 00:26:23,566
press

424
00:26:23,899 --> 00:26:26,971
rabbi button you really want to execute
on it as efficiently

425
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:30,717
as possible you have you ever gone to
get a cup of coffee and then you're

426
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:32,450
faced with

427
00:26:32,045 --> 00:26:36,984
a long slow moving line and fair you to
fight forget it

428
00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:41,200
that's where you don't wanna have an in
your apt our game

429
00:26:41,002 --> 00:26:44,077
minimizing but the time and the number
steps that it takes

430
00:26:44,095 --> 00:26:48,524
make a per-share keeps people really
engaged in your apt not thinking about

431
00:26:49,379 --> 00:26:53,402
that purchasing process

432
00:26:53,609 --> 00:26:56,688
so this is super not it's a builder game
that takes place

433
00:26:57,399 --> 00:27:01,497
in space not quite out worldwide you at
first eighteen very soon cuz you're

434
00:27:02,379 --> 00:27:04,447
probably gonna fire aftermath

435
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:08,154
now right now I'm in the process of
preparing my TV hatin as you can see it

436
00:27:09,009 --> 00:27:09,710
for all

437
00:27:09,071 --> 00:27:12,840
have that I got the mama I wanna ask for
more timber

438
00:27:13,479 --> 00:27:19,507
but this is gonna cost me 8 time and now

439
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:25,825
hi everyone so what happens when i press
that green button

440
00:27:26,419 --> 00:27:30,330
I can get some jams right here I don't
have to go anywhere

441
00:27:30,033 --> 00:27:35,432
I can stay right in that moment have FTV
hot repair

442
00:27:35,729 --> 00:27:39,830
so in addition to clearly fading what
I'm gonna get 200 am

443
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:44,158
for $4.99 they're often reminded me why
I am seeing this in the first place

444
00:27:45,058 --> 00:27:50,147
I need seven more only have one I needed
a and maybe even flock to the package

445
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:54,440
from Sams that's closest to what I
needed

446
00:27:54,044 --> 00:27:57,383
happens that this is the smallest
Packers exams but then I can make a

447
00:27:57,779 --> 00:27:58,878
decision really quickly

448
00:27:59,769 --> 00:28:04,782
I mean yes they have exams star and yes
I have many more options in it

449
00:28:04,899 --> 00:28:08,440
but taking me away from it. he had as
more disruptive

450
00:28:08,044 --> 00:28:11,653
money we just a pair stay focused on
building

451
00:28:12,049 --> 00:28:15,103
because building is what I came here to
do you

452
00:28:15,589 --> 00:28:18,677
you never wanted to start a game prior
from playing the game

453
00:28:19,469 --> 00:28:23,500
that's the fun part distracting them
makes it easier for them since walk away

454
00:28:23,779 --> 00:28:26,804
entirely

455
00:28:27,029 --> 00:28:31,450
similarly candy crush saga handle fits
really well of them

456
00:28:31,045 --> 00:28:34,774
get you have those boosters at beginning
at every level

457
00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:38,182
and you have the option to purchasing
them right here

458
00:28:38,479 --> 00:28:41,940
they're not shipping me off to a candy
store with a million different things to

459
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:42,743
choose from

460
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:47,598
would you like this booster here's the
price buy it back in the game

461
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:52,723
fast and efficient right at the moment
when I can use that

462
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:57,450
now another thing to think about it
preloading images and data third fair

463
00:28:57,045 --> 00:28:58,824
when people need it

464
00:28:59,229 --> 00:29:03,248
this is because you're black that's
another kind a match-3 puzzle game

465
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:07,580
now yearn clients as you're playing and
then use the coins to buy rare gem

466
00:29:07,058 --> 00:29:11,077
which then help you do better on the
very have of

467
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:14,632
now every day you can also get some free
coins from

468
00:29:14,929 --> 00:29:17,977
the steering wheel

469
00:29:18,409 --> 00:29:21,415
now you get one free throw in for David
of course you can by

470
00:29:21,469 --> 00:29:25,710
more sense if you like and we all pretty
generous

471
00:29:25,071 --> 00:29:28,870
so imagine that you're excited you're
like okay you know what I'm doing really

472
00:29:29,509 --> 00:29:32,543
good in the tournament this week I wanna
be my friend

473
00:29:32,849 --> 00:29:36,857
let me go get some more spans see what
happens what if your face

474
00:29:36,929 --> 00:29:39,997
with death people don't like waiting

475
00:29:40,609 --> 00:29:45,683
that's like that long line at the coffee
store your FM not sticking around

476
00:29:46,349 --> 00:29:50,070
now thankfully which hope with seventy
you that faye

477
00:29:50,007 --> 00:29:54,346
they learned everything immediately
where you want to do is be

478
00:29:54,409 --> 00:29:57,483
aware what people are likely to purchase
based on where they are

479
00:29:58,149 --> 00:30:02,830
any rapper Game and then you can look
for times to thoughtfully preloaded

480
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:06,632
so that their data and images are
available awesome someone need it

481
00:30:07,379 --> 00:30:10,466
so this screen is only accessible from
that we off-screen

482
00:30:11,249 --> 00:30:14,261
so it's the perfect opportunity to
preload those them into

483
00:30:14,369 --> 00:30:17,411
cannot be available the images and data
will be there

484
00:30:17,789 --> 00:30:20,812
people seek it out

485
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:25,023
and one final temp as you said cash
artwork appropriately

486
00:30:25,059 --> 00:30:27,820
so it's not gonna have to load
everything all time if it doesn't meet

487
00:30:27,082 --> 00:30:28,087
you

488
00:30:29,032 --> 00:30:32,032
now after lunch in this room we have a
great fashion

489
00:30:32,032 --> 00:30:35,231
about optimizing in app purchases with
store cat

490
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:38,598
so I highly recommend you come out come
back after lunch and check it out

491
00:30:39,309 --> 00:30:39,393
because there's

492
00:30:40,149 --> 00:30:46,158
a lot of great tips for avoiding common
pitfall

493
00:30:46,239 --> 00:30:50,190
now finally what you can do to make the
buying process easier on people is to

494
00:30:50,019 --> 00:30:52,838
inspire people

495
00:30:53,009 --> 00:30:56,058
someone may not want something have a
don't know what the possibility of a

496
00:30:56,499 --> 00:30:56,565
death

497
00:30:57,159 --> 00:31:00,256
they don't understand how its ruler
feature could help them

498
00:31:01,129 --> 00:31:05,460
or have what they could achieve with
that

499
00:31:05,046 --> 00:31:08,255
now I'm not saying that you want to turn
everything in for an advertising

500
00:31:08,669 --> 00:31:10,756
experience again we're not trying to be
pushy

501
00:31:11,539 --> 00:31:14,578
but there's a lotta ways that you can
really naturally illustrates

502
00:31:14,929 --> 00:31:19,200
how things can be years

503
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:22,391
paper by 53 does this beautiful a

504
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:26,595
they've got their sample Journal that
the staff is made that shows off not

505
00:31:26,649 --> 00:31:28,820
only what the tools are capable of

506
00:31:28,082 --> 00:31:32,661
but of a different ways they could be
used you know maybe 10 wireframe

507
00:31:33,399 --> 00:31:38,445
with it or maybe you wanna make some
artwork

508
00:31:38,859 --> 00:31:42,944
now another thing they do well as give
suggestive tired also the blank journals

509
00:31:43,709 --> 00:31:47,747
maybe you haven't considered sketching
or journaling with a fat now we're going

510
00:31:48,089 --> 00:31:49,171
to you

511
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:53,932
now have a gallery artwork created by
people using the app

512
00:31:54,139 --> 00:32:00,163
regular people and ask our shows off the
variety of styles that's achievable

513
00:32:00,379 --> 00:32:06,471
where you can do with the tools and also
how the app can be used

514
00:32:07,299 --> 00:32:10,323
me you can make some amazing artwork but
you also might want to use that for

515
00:32:10,539 --> 00:32:13,563
architectural rendering

516
00:32:13,779 --> 00:32:16,844
and if that doesn't get you inspired
maybe the idea of having your work

517
00:32:17,429 --> 00:32:19,511
featured here is very exciting

518
00:32:20,249 --> 00:32:24,297
for you just gotta ho Arthur A ways that
you can use the app and see what the

519
00:32:24,729 --> 00:32:28,734
tools are capable of

520
00:32:28,779 --> 00:32:32,876
now again with games and with super not
South Perth very well

521
00:32:33,749 --> 00:32:36,776
kind of a different approach for the
same idea

522
00:32:37,019 --> 00:32:40,048
so after you learn the basic gameplay
with super not

523
00:32:40,309 --> 00:32:43,404
their reward you for visiting other
people world

524
00:32:44,259 --> 00:32:47,307
now like I said this is a builder games
to your working on building up

525
00:32:47,739 --> 00:32:52,754
your property and seeing how creative
other people a ban is super inspiring

526
00:32:52,889 --> 00:32:55,988
for your own place now this is how you
start of

527
00:32:56,879 --> 00:32:59,975
pretty basic in the first 15 minutes
you're gonna get some real basic

528
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:02,690
structures guy

529
00:33:02,069 --> 00:33:05,408
and after a couple hours you might wind
up with something like that or

530
00:33:06,029 --> 00:33:09,031
something like my TD hat

531
00:33:09,049 --> 00:33:13,120
and when you get for a couple hours
eating okay I know what's going on

532
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:17,759
I have an idea what's possible but it's
only when you go

533
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:20,855
to visit other people's worlds do you
really get a fan

534
00:33:21,719 --> 00:33:27,728
for what's coming for what can be
created

535
00:33:27,809 --> 00:33:30,834
so check these out these are all real
player

536
00:33:31,059 --> 00:33:35,064
this is not the Super not screw
createdby

537
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:42,559
amazing right me my TV hat is super lame
by comparison

538
00:33:42,989 --> 00:33:49,057
yeah yeah and now I'm excited now I
wanna go in at a drag an hour

539
00:33:49,669 --> 00:33:53,730
you know a rainbow our flager messages
to my friends

540
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:57,373
I mean it makes it gets you excited
about spending more time building thing

541
00:33:58,219 --> 00:34:04,295
make something really cool and you can
see what material are so forthcoming

542
00:34:04,979 --> 00:34:08,950
so as you're thinking about how how to
make it the buying process

543
00:34:08,095 --> 00:34:14,176
easier make sure that people can see
what's available with no after

544
00:34:15,076 --> 00:34:18,080
how people understand the value what
you're offering

545
00:34:18,008 --> 00:34:21,024
give them that test drive experience

546
00:34:21,096 --> 00:34:24,151
and then when it comes to the
transaction make sure that you can

547
00:34:25,051 --> 00:34:26,096
process on it fast

548
00:34:26,096 --> 00:34:30,096
and efficient and don't forget to get
people

549
00:34:30,096 --> 00:34:34,005
excited about what you're offering

550
00:34:34,869 --> 00:34:38,440
but the story doesn't end here your job
not over just getting them to push the

551
00:34:38,044 --> 00:34:39,153
buy button

552
00:34:39,549 --> 00:34:42,990
there's a lot of things that need to
happen to complete the transaction

553
00:34:42,099 --> 00:34:47,268
in order to contain have a continue to
be a really great experience

554
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,010
the first away its is and new feature
coming in the fall

555
00:34:52,001 --> 00:34:56,022
and Tim touched on their very briefly
but I'd like to spend a little more time

556
00:34:56,022 --> 00:34:57,411
because this is gonna impact

557
00:34:57,609 --> 00:35:01,010
everyone and that's after by

558
00:35:01,001 --> 00:35:05,760
fell in the fall you'll be able to
associate up to six people on household

559
00:35:05,769 --> 00:35:07,480
as a family

560
00:35:07,048 --> 00:35:10,120
and have parted that's we're gonna have
a new printer control called after I

561
00:35:11,002 --> 00:35:15,099
and if it's a name of this means that a
parent is gonna approve or decline

562
00:35:16,017 --> 00:35:21,095
any purchases that a child makes so it's
basically the criminal best

563
00:35:21,095 --> 00:35:25,514
can I have it please 33 but it's all
gonna happen

564
00:35:26,369 --> 00:35:29,444
through your devices so here's how it
works

565
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:33,161
today when you're out fans request

566
00:35:33,539 --> 00:35:39,170
to purchase something you're going to
get a response right back

567
00:35:39,017 --> 00:35:42,075
that purchase our fam

568
00:35:42,075 --> 00:35:45,904
now without to buy we're gonna check
with the parent for

569
00:35:46,579 --> 00:35:49,651
about survived the name out so you're
gonna summer across for purchasing

570
00:35:50,299 --> 00:35:53,930
the child can ask for something on the
App Store is gonna check with the

571
00:35:53,093 --> 00:35:54,119
parents

572
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:58,067
so what does that mean to you during
Mass

573
00:35:58,067 --> 00:36:03,726
time you're gonna get a response back up
too far

574
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:09,260
and then once the parent accepts or
decline for a class

575
00:36:09,026 --> 00:36:13,099
that's on the App Store will let you
know whether it's been purchased her fam

576
00:36:13,099 --> 00:36:17,121
and this deford's taken off for up to 24
hour

577
00:36:18,021 --> 00:36:21,100
while waiting for a response from the
parent rivers no response within 24

578
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,849
hours

579
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:26,893
it's going to default to fail and the
child can request again

580
00:36:27,289 --> 00:36:30,940
so what does this mean from a design
perspective

581
00:36:30,094 --> 00:36:33,473
well if you have moral situation

582
00:36:34,319 --> 00:36:37,368
where people are doing purchasing you
need to shift over

583
00:36:37,809 --> 00:36:40,834
turn a synchronous model

584
00:36:41,059 --> 00:36:44,087
let's say your game offers boosters at
beginning a Lavar

585
00:36:44,339 --> 00:36:47,390
and a child makes her quest to buy one
you know what that's how

586
00:36:47,849 --> 00:36:50,854
stuck there waiting for up to 24 hours
see here

587
00:36:51,349 --> 00:36:54,920
whether they can have a booster for the
next level right I can guarantee you

588
00:36:54,092 --> 00:36:57,116
they're not gonna stick around that long

589
00:36:58,016 --> 00:37:02,215
so what can you do while you have to
figure out what's going to be bath

590
00:37:02,359 --> 00:37:06,200
for your after your game the important
thing is that you let people

591
00:37:06,002 --> 00:37:09,045
keep using and enjoying your app during
this time

592
00:37:09,063 --> 00:37:12,982
for child requested a booster well you
summer costs of

593
00:37:13,549 --> 00:37:17,460
for the parents for proof but then you
could let them play other level of

594
00:37:17,046 --> 00:37:20,144
or maybe they continue playing the level
but without the booster

595
00:37:21,044 --> 00:37:23,141
and when that approval comes then your
bank and let them use it at a different

596
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:26,099
time

597
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:29,151
another thing that you want to think
about it giving some sort of feedback

598
00:37:30,051 --> 00:37:33,096
inside application so that the child
remember

599
00:37:33,096 --> 00:37:37,415
that something is pending but they've
already asked mom and dad

600
00:37:38,279 --> 00:37:41,940
and felt that you could update no label
on the button

601
00:37:41,094 --> 00:37:45,503
say something out or in the App Store we
show our method

602
00:37:46,349 --> 00:37:50,170
help the child remember that it's
actually pending

603
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:53,066
power any people using a wrapper under
18

604
00:37:53,066 --> 00:37:56,101
you need to start preparing for that now

605
00:37:57,001 --> 00:38:00,026
that differed fate is entirely in a row
and you need to make sure you're

606
00:38:00,026 --> 00:38:01,565
handling it well

607
00:38:01,799 --> 00:38:05,400
make sure people can still continue to
use your app

608
00:38:05,004 --> 00:38:09,663
for your game while that differed fate
is happening

609
00:38:10,059 --> 00:38:14,157
and you want to make sure that if a
response is pending that they have from

610
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:15,690
feedback

611
00:38:15,069 --> 00:38:18,168
there it's really important to note that
this isn't just

612
00:38:19,068 --> 00:38:23,457
Iowa State Fair don't think that waiting
for up to a year after game is going to

613
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:27,010
get you outta best because it's not
going to happen

614
00:38:27,001 --> 00:38:31,043
the ability to create families is what's
coming with my life a day

615
00:38:31,043 --> 00:38:34,067
but this ask my permission is going to
apply

616
00:38:34,067 --> 00:38:39,266
to older versions iraq Mac OS and Apple
TV

617
00:38:39,869 --> 00:38:43,420
cysts are preparing now

618
00:38:43,042 --> 00:38:46,046
now whether or not a transaction
complete immediately

619
00:38:46,046 --> 00:38:50,125
or up to 24 hours later you always want
to confirm that

620
00:38:50,539 --> 00:38:53,980
that transactions completed let people
now

621
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:56,887
sat on their mom help people find
whatever they just bought

622
00:38:57,769 --> 00:39:00,823
let them now that it's available for
years

623
00:39:01,309 --> 00:39:04,990
an example that you guys probably see
all the time as the App Store

624
00:39:04,099 --> 00:39:07,147
Sarah soon as you confirm payment for
application

625
00:39:08,047 --> 00:39:13,071
you see that the app starts down you get
that feedback something's happening

626
00:39:13,071 --> 00:39:17,163
nothing's gone wrong your merchandise is
being transferred to you

627
00:39:18,063 --> 00:39:21,064
and then you can open an app directly
from the App Store

628
00:39:21,073 --> 00:39:24,147
you have to go digging around all your
home screen filled with maps to find it

629
00:39:25,047 --> 00:39:30,064
you can just start playing threes right
there for hours

630
00:39:30,064 --> 00:39:33,503
now another thing to think about is if
you have a game or

631
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:38,210
children top something really fun you
can make this a fun experience by using

632
00:39:38,021 --> 00:39:40,100
sound and animation

633
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,065
so this is heads up at the game that's
really popular

634
00:39:44,065 --> 00:39:48,090
with Ellen DeGeneres pipette honor TV
show all the time

635
00:39:48,009 --> 00:39:53,064
a little bit like charades designed to
play it with real people in real life

636
00:39:54,045 --> 00:39:57,134
each of these Dacca theme cards are
topics that you can

637
00:39:57,539 --> 00:40:01,612
act out for your friends and try and gas
now they give you a couple theme packs

638
00:40:02,269 --> 00:40:04,272
to get going to start playing

639
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:08,390
but then they also offer attire other
theme packs

640
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:12,508
to enhance enhance the experience so
check out what happens when you buy

641
00:40:12,859 --> 00:40:19,859
wanna be I happen to be in eighties fun

642
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:28,400
she get that down and that animation
that lets you know something else happen

643
00:40:28,769 --> 00:40:32,770
the purchase has gone through and the
name animate back up to the top

644
00:40:32,779 --> 00:40:39,779
so you can see where cards arms are
playing right away

645
00:40:40,009 --> 00:40:45,150
now confirming that the transaction is
completed

646
00:40:45,015 --> 00:40:49,023
is especially important when asked by
because your customer may not be

647
00:40:49,095 --> 00:40:53,454
at the same place where they were when
they requested the transaction right

648
00:40:54,309 --> 00:40:59,220
so if you had a comic app and say the
child as browsing all the comics that

649
00:40:59,022 --> 00:41:00,065
are available

650
00:41:00,065 --> 00:41:03,934
may request on and while they're waiting
for Mom or Dad except at

651
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:08,603
well then they go and read one other
issues parity half

652
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:12,454
the need to think about if that
transaction complete

653
00:41:13,309 --> 00:41:16,387
how are you gonna let people now the
complete at a later time how you gonna

654
00:41:17,089 --> 00:41:19,134
let people know where their merchandise
fair

655
00:41:19,539 --> 00:41:23,542
and how to find it

656
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:26,960
now no one wants a fee error code 128

657
00:41:26,096 --> 00:41:30,975
right confusing and frustrating except
someone

658
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:36,690
and it can be a little alarming for you
wanna know your codes and present

659
00:41:36,069 --> 00:41:41,072
information away it's going to be
meaningful to the people using your apt

660
00:41:41,072 --> 00:41:46,881
not all areas may require spot you don't
have to tell your people everything

661
00:41:47,529 --> 00:41:51,533
now if someone did cancel transaction
let's say that you're using an app or

662
00:41:51,569 --> 00:41:53,663
game change your mind about something
you can split

663
00:41:54,509 --> 00:41:57,970
is this what you wanna see it doesn't
make sense

664
00:41:57,097 --> 00:42:01,216
you may not need to notify people at all
or you may just wanna make this a little

665
00:42:02,089 --> 00:42:02,094
more

666
00:42:02,589 --> 00:42:06,210
customer-friendly cell

667
00:42:06,021 --> 00:42:09,670
the best experience of course is to
avoid errors entirely

668
00:42:09,859 --> 00:42:14,200
so again this afternoon fast and
optimizing stark at is gonna have a ton

669
00:42:14,002 --> 00:42:15,050
of technical taps

670
00:42:15,068 --> 00:42:21,123
about avoiding errors and all those
comments fast

671
00:42:22,023 --> 00:42:25,041
now another thing that I see sometimes
is that people tend to

672
00:42:25,041 --> 00:42:30,065
over after purchase as you wanna let
folks get some enjoyment

673
00:42:30,065 --> 00:42:33,964
out of what they just pop before you
start asking them to buy something again

674
00:42:34,549 --> 00:42:37,960
again don't be that guy

675
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:40,141
it's like Christmas for you and rafter
toy

676
00:42:41,041 --> 00:42:45,050
are all excited and then you realize
Arjan come with any

677
00:42:45,005 --> 00:42:49,124
battery disappointing right

678
00:42:49,619 --> 00:42:52,710
me just took something that was a really
joyous occasion and turn it into a

679
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:56,230
frustrating experience for people

680
00:42:56,023 --> 00:42:59,074
so make sure that when someone by
something that they can use what they

681
00:42:59,074 --> 00:43:00,091
just spot

682
00:43:00,091 --> 00:43:03,690
give them that satisfaction they
shouldn't have to make a subsequent

683
00:43:04,509 --> 00:43:04,588
purchase

684
00:43:05,299 --> 00:43:10,500
in order to enjoy

685
00:43:10,005 --> 00:43:13,084
and then like I said earlier less is
more

686
00:43:13,579 --> 00:43:16,579
you wanna prioritized for Manning person
that

687
00:43:16,579 --> 00:43:19,631
how people focus on what's still
available to them

688
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:24,123
if there's things they can't buy d
prioritize bad in the UI

689
00:43:24,339 --> 00:43:27,437
especially with nonconvex of there's no
need to keep showing people something

690
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:29,390
that they've already bought

691
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:35,158
they already own it now in some cases it
may not make sense to hide items that

692
00:43:35,509 --> 00:43:36,541
have already been purchased

693
00:43:36,829 --> 00:43:42,852
but just don't let them be the star the
shower

694
00:43:43,059 --> 00:43:46,220
and I think you're all aware that it's
very important

695
00:43:46,022 --> 00:43:49,041
that you let people restore their
purchase that that they've made

696
00:43:49,041 --> 00:43:50,093
previously

697
00:43:50,093 --> 00:43:53,972
they could have made it on another
device or they got a new piece of

698
00:43:54,809 --> 00:43:56,450
hardware

699
00:43:56,045 --> 00:43:59,120
and it's important that they can
retrieve what they've already got

700
00:44:00,002 --> 00:44:03,571
this is broken magazine and they make it
super easy

701
00:44:03,769 --> 00:44:06,854
if you already have a subscription well
here's where to go to start that restore

702
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:09,658
process

703
00:44:10,009 --> 00:44:14,450
but they took it one step further so if
you were to tap on one of the

704
00:44:14,045 --> 00:44:15,123
subscription options

705
00:44:16,023 --> 00:44:20,052
you get the confirmation for subscribe
to fight you an ex tax:

706
00:44:20,259 --> 00:44:23,260
but if you can't fall

707
00:44:23,269 --> 00:44:27,150
they ask if you are already a subscriber
and of course there's basically two

708
00:44:27,015 --> 00:44:28,904
reasons why

709
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:32,130
you might cancel subscription
confirmation

710
00:44:32,013 --> 00:44:35,022
one as if you change your mind about
subscribing

711
00:44:35,022 --> 00:44:39,401
of course and that's a much bigger
problem for them to tackle

712
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:43,690
but the other is if you already had a
subscription so in this case for helping

713
00:44:43,069 --> 00:44:46,638
get you back on track

714
00:44:47,259 --> 00:44:50,337
now you all know it's an app store
requirements make restoring

715
00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:56,890
available but a great experience is
gonna make it easy

716
00:44:56,089 --> 00:44:59,093
art someone must have been there faction
and

717
00:44:59,093 --> 00:45:02,140
and this is about notification you want
to use them

718
00:45:03,004 --> 00:45:06,973
stop by and this applies to push
notification

719
00:45:07,369 --> 00:45:10,490
as well as local notification

720
00:45:10,049 --> 00:45:13,072
now you're not gonna have to notify
children about after I

721
00:45:13,072 --> 00:45:17,094
purchases complaining because the app
stores gonna handle that for you

722
00:45:17,094 --> 00:45:21,273
but you do you want to use notifications
to let people know about new contact for

723
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:22,420
Earth

724
00:45:22,042 --> 00:45:26,891
scripts an or maybe and those dating app
speak about me know if I have new

725
00:45:27,269 --> 00:45:30,980
recommended mass at circa

726
00:45:30,098 --> 00:45:33,150
a great job with their notification they
serve up

727
00:45:34,005 --> 00:45:38,096
bite 5 news articles and and they give
you updates as it's happening

728
00:45:39,041 --> 00:45:42,064
now they're only gonna send
notifications FL article about I

729
00:45:42,064 --> 00:45:44,066
explicitly follow

730
00:45:44,066 --> 00:45:47,465
orbit something that they consider
breaking news

731
00:45:48,059 --> 00:45:52,104
and its they're very to see about what
they consider breaking news

732
00:45:52,509 --> 00:45:56,591
now this is not breaking news this is
what I followed earlier

733
00:45:57,329 --> 00:46:01,500
writing on that notification takes you
directly articles you can read all about

734
00:46:01,005 --> 00:46:01,824
it

735
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:07,322
so they've made it really easy for me to
return to the contact

736
00:46:07,619 --> 00:46:10,626
see you wanna be really thought far
about the kind and the number

737
00:46:11,319 --> 00:46:15,450
notification that you're standing cuz
too many notifications

738
00:46:15,045 --> 00:46:19,070
just gonna know why everybody and not
only do your FN turning off

739
00:46:19,007 --> 00:46:20,061
notifications entirely

740
00:46:21,024 --> 00:46:26,043
they might just wanna to reading your
app if they get tired about notification

741
00:46:26,043 --> 00:46:29,172
that not experience that we're after
right you what

742
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:33,583
of America cation that will keep people
coming back

743
00:46:33,799 --> 00:46:39,874
make the app feel more valuable because
family there's new content there

744
00:46:40,549 --> 00:46:43,960
okay so make sure that you consider the
saying

745
00:46:43,096 --> 00:46:49,164
after customers Afghan completing the
transaction is super important

746
00:46:50,064 --> 00:46:54,243
which brings us to the final third stage
have a great experience with an app

747
00:46:54,819 --> 00:46:55,892
purchased at and not

748
00:46:56,549 --> 00:47:02,470
measuring and refining with all good
design it's our important a rate

749
00:47:02,047 --> 00:47:05,122
you want to measure the success and
quite frankly the failures

750
00:47:06,022 --> 00:47:09,911
avoid try see how that has an effect on
paying

751
00:47:10,109 --> 00:47:13,176
and then make changes based on our

752
00:47:13,779 --> 00:47:17,390
I mean all the things that I mentioned
today are gonna work for all product

753
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:17,116
types in

754
00:47:18,016 --> 00:47:23,019
audiences for the more that you really
fine tune your approach the batter

755
00:47:23,019 --> 00:47:29,040
more factor animeme so here are some
questions that you can ask yourself

756
00:47:29,004 --> 00:47:33,086
about the changes they made to help
determine whether they were successful

757
00:47:34,022 --> 00:47:37,911
so when where the changes made and what
we're reading super important

758
00:47:38,109 --> 00:47:42,480
I you wanna make a detailed note about
exactly when he may change as

759
00:47:42,048 --> 00:47:47,120
and all the things that you updated
something the matter translator

760
00:47:48,002 --> 00:47:51,053
you are trying to figure out how have
the number change it house number

761
00:47:51,071 --> 00:47:53,380
purchases change

762
00:47:54,019 --> 00:47:57,490
hopefully they've gone up rights

763
00:47:57,049 --> 00:48:01,368
and are different things being purchased
from different places in the application

764
00:48:01,809 --> 00:48:08,809
as a result integrating our merchandise
reselling higher value items

765
00:48:08,809 --> 00:48:10,905
and what's the average revenue per
device and this is going to be really

766
00:48:11,769 --> 00:48:15,200
easy to see in the fall with the new
iTunes can act because we have a

767
00:48:15,002 --> 00:48:19,006
tired after analytics coming for you
offer free

768
00:48:19,024 --> 00:48:23,039
and this helps you learn whether or not
a marketing campaign was worth it

769
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:26,408
if you invested a certain amount of
money per device

770
00:48:26,759 --> 00:48:30,460
and you're not saying that revenue come
back and well back campaign

771
00:48:30,046 --> 00:48:33,067
not gonna be going back at 4 a.m.

772
00:48:33,067 --> 00:48:36,115
and finally keep an eye out our people
returning

773
00:48:37,015 --> 00:48:41,093
more frequently because if they are
that's an indication that you have a

774
00:48:41,093 --> 00:48:41,189
really great

775
00:48:42,089 --> 00:48:48,140
experience but the quality experiences

776
00:48:49,004 --> 00:48:54,011
fat I hope that you guys will take at
least one other design tips that I gave

777
00:48:54,047 --> 00:48:55,146
each day

778
00:48:55,569 --> 00:48:58,950
