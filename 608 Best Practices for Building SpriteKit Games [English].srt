1
00:00:16,081 --> 00:00:19,115
hello everyone my name's sake I have the
pleasure of managing the scheme

2
00:00:20,015 --> 00:00:24,047
modest team I'll I'm here to today to
start to offer the best practices from

3
00:00:24,047 --> 00:00:24,115
will expect

4
00:00:25,015 --> 00:00:29,041
game so we're gonna start this off with
talking a little bit

5
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:33,120
but this respect it one-years-old I am

6
00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:37,710
you guys from eight thousand news
bracket and I'm sure you've seen from

7
00:00:37,071 --> 00:00:38,600
successful ones out there like

8
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,610
100 balls for example even achieving
that the top on Fri spot

9
00:00:43,061 --> 00:00:47,440
so what you guys have done with it is
absolutely amazing

10
00:00:47,989 --> 00:00:50,960
and we hope that from the new features
without it really gonna help you make

11
00:00:50,096 --> 00:00:50,875
that next game

12
00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:55,260
so let's go through with the stocks can
you about

13
00:00:55,026 --> 00:00:58,061
we can discuss

14
00:00:58,061 --> 00:01:02,094
skill-building best practices to help
you save on costs you develop your game

15
00:01:02,094 --> 00:01:05,182
and also set yourself up for the future
we can talk about

16
00:01:06,082 --> 00:01:10,661
game structure best practices and then
nikka go talk to you about performance

17
00:01:11,399 --> 00:01:12,210
prospects

18
00:01:12,021 --> 00:01:15,109
so did Australian to skill ability to
strike sis

19
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:20,017
so what i'm talking about here is
setting yourself up

20
00:01:20,017 --> 00:01:24,078
so that you can add content to your game
with the smallest possible cost

21
00:01:24,078 --> 00:01:27,120
so you can collaborate with the rescue
team

22
00:01:28,002 --> 00:01:32,006
and also perhaps work better for the
future

23
00:01:32,024 --> 00:01:36,029
learning polytechnics so all the
problems vacancy as a as a

24
00:01:36,074 --> 00:01:39,343
beginning in developer I used to be one
of those

25
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:44,106
is you get really excited and so you
start on this idea that you have

26
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:49,130
in a mean the ideas right you want to
get your game going as fast as possible

27
00:01:49,013 --> 00:01:53,036
sea diving hard code everything's done
in one scene

28
00:01:53,036 --> 00:01:57,036
all orifices done in the one placing
code

29
00:01:57,036 --> 00:02:02,495
a hard code level 1 level 2

30
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:05,847
was be more work to make a difference
level 3

31
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:09,101
looks the same cuz face it you just did
copy and paste

32
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,300
and well you probably stuck on all four

33
00:02:12,003 --> 00:02:16,009
you thinkin different asking time
probably going to copy and paste again

34
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:20,052
the second problem is you tend to get
tempted

35
00:02:21,033 --> 00:02:24,055
to write data as code

36
00:02:24,055 --> 00:02:27,122
and here's just an example of some you
could get stuck doing

37
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:31,080
even inspected on suspected as is
actually probably look fabulous but

38
00:02:31,008 --> 00:02:34,027
you like a circus another API your

39
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:37,128
encoding things like the position your
nodes

40
00:02:38,028 --> 00:02:41,082
inside code your including rotations

41
00:02:41,082 --> 00:02:44,111
you're probably when encoding the number
of objects you have

42
00:02:45,011 --> 00:02:48,049
in code maybe encoding properties like
me.

43
00:02:48,049 --> 00:02:51,135
point to get what types units are the
colors

44
00:02:52,035 --> 00:02:57,083
in code and we end up with is that

45
00:02:57,083 --> 00:03:01,092
you may change Rs its meaning in the
coat

46
00:03:01,092 --> 00:03:05,095
right so now the artist and the code
above admitted to the same time

47
00:03:06,022 --> 00:03:09,075
the only visual feedback you get miss
you build run

48
00:03:09,075 --> 00:03:14,079
radiation talisman worsened and you're
forcing you to sign this reprogramming

49
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:14,608
scares

50
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:21,470
the data code 22 games I'm on the second
level here

51
00:03:21,047 --> 00:03:24,134
you also duplicated structural code and

52
00:03:25,034 --> 00:03:28,075
court date is not very efficient I
they're they're better way to describe

53
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:28,152
data

54
00:03:29,052 --> 00:03:34,101
namely they up I'll and also targeted
collaboratively because

55
00:03:35,001 --> 00:03:38,097
you're probably doing this at its in the
same and more mm file

56
00:03:38,097 --> 00:03:42,100
for all the changes so artist has
changed and our asset

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,048
11m file change so when you first tosses
to look exactly the same as

58
00:03:47,048 --> 00:03:50,136
game designer changing browner so

59
00:03:51,036 --> 00:03:54,053
the solution while

60
00:03:54,053 --> 00:03:57,059
you get a separate game content from
game logic a storm touched on earlier

61
00:03:58,013 --> 00:04:01,112
you wanna separate few structure from
assets

62
00:04:02,012 --> 00:04:06,014
so structurally she might be different
from the actual artwork delivered

63
00:04:06,014 --> 00:04:10,443
annual separate data from code we also

64
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:14,920
wanna make sure you visualizing as early
as possible building on its not the best

65
00:04:14,092 --> 00:04:17,741
system in the world done so

66
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:21,569
implement solution

67
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:26,000
consists of opening game logic in my
scene but I am referencing that here

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,088
because that's what you get

69
00:04:26,088 --> 00:04:31,099
template you for two games structure
inside the think it's your life up

70
00:04:31,099 --> 00:04:34,101
the my scene SKS anybody seen

71
00:04:35,019 --> 00:04:39,080
affect in several SKS files but you're
referencing and if you can decide car

72
00:04:39,008 --> 00:04:39,046
dealer

73
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:44,019
we are fantastic former cop you lift
which is XML

74
00:04:44,028 --> 00:04:49,667
on at and buy me when you deploy so the
tools that we provide for you to do this

75
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,040
in Xcode 6 israel's have a strike a
template both objective-c

76
00:04:54,004 --> 00:04:57,060
and swift editor as long as or earlier

77
00:04:57,006 --> 00:05:01,024
let's give your feedback official
editing she because media

78
00:05:01,078 --> 00:05:04,094
and you can also add a.m.

79
00:05:04,094 --> 00:05:07,095
simulate if it's clutch

80
00:05:08,004 --> 00:05:12,007
we also have and have had for a long
time the ability for you to add a purist

81
00:05:12,007 --> 00:05:12,091
files

82
00:05:12,091 --> 00:05:15,570
inside Xcode as a simple screening
appeals follow

83
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:20,250
adding a raise dictionaries to them and
reading them back in you could a super

84
00:05:20,025 --> 00:05:22,123
simple

85
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:26,028
so no show you a demo love respected
public

86
00:05:26,073 --> 00:05:31,130
and how easy it is to get set up but the
wrong way and the right way

87
00:05:32,003 --> 00:05:39,003
okay so let me show you here

88
00:05:43,033 --> 00:05:46,042
my very rushed example making a

89
00:05:47,023 --> 00:05:52,040
sorta topple over the towers game

90
00:05:52,004 --> 00:05:55,553
so I made a a little hammer throwing him
here

91
00:05:55,949 --> 00:06:00,400
a store that totem and I get score

92
00:06:00,004 --> 00:06:03,055
are so excited I'm making this so I just
threw everything

93
00:06:03,091 --> 00:06:06,100
its overusing Inka

94
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,068
I'm sure another you ever see this for
arm

95
00:06:10,068 --> 00:06:14,027
you see here on reference York right
inside the scenes file

96
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,790
I'm sitting positions things into new
properties

97
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:20,087
so I got this going to quickly and it
seems is totally wrong for you to do

98
00:06:21,059 --> 00:06:24,140
whatever you do to make money and get
success is great

99
00:06:25,004 --> 00:06:28,041
I'll just can provide an alternative so

100
00:06:28,077 --> 00:06:32,083
this ran that the job that's great

101
00:06:33,037 --> 00:06:36,556
however you could structure this

102
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:40,060
slightly differently so here have a
scene

103
00:06:40,006 --> 00:06:44,087
which first-world with Richard operate
in a similar fashion

104
00:06:44,087 --> 00:06:47,104
okay yep

105
00:06:48,004 --> 00:06:51,086
the same stuff used to using game

106
00:06:51,086 --> 00:06:54,125
what I've done here so use the spark a
template

107
00:06:55,025 --> 00:06:58,056
which provides you start of

108
00:06:58,056 --> 00:07:02,059
Sebring code and affect

109
00:07:02,059 --> 00:07:06,094
lucky you're gonna see is right on this
line here

110
00:07:06,094 --> 00:07:10,136
game scene archive from file seems kinda
cool

111
00:07:11,036 --> 00:07:14,625
what's actually happening well the
template here has set you up with

112
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:18,990
something to meeting you guys that we
have the already using from foundation

113
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:22,118
school and is keyed archiver the value
load

114
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:26,030
save all data this release see

115
00:07:26,003 --> 00:07:29,006
perspective so

116
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:32,402
this a super special people magic that
we doing here

117
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:36,330
we're telling Ricky darker to replace
any instance

118
00:07:36,033 --> 00:07:39,087
SKC with their own class

119
00:07:39,087 --> 00:07:43,416
listening for any occasion that you laid
you can make it automatically load

120
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:48,460
on own info so now is time logic
together with assets

121
00:07:48,046 --> 00:07:51,087
even the time separately

122
00:07:51,087 --> 00:07:55,106
okay I was going to the actual games
here

123
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:59,350
noticed the setup level one here is

124
00:07:59,035 --> 00:08:03,086
markedly smaller than it was in the
previous example

125
00:08:03,086 --> 00:08:06,485
soul what's happening here well we're
using

126
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:10,280
spike its powerful search features to
Newry

127
00:08:10,028 --> 00:08:13,041
through the continent seen and by green

128
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:16,920
upon no names and conventions with you
artist

129
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:21,660
you can make it really easy to pull the
logical a metallic sheen

130
00:08:21,066 --> 00:08:25,165
by name and her team up to code here

131
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,750
we've said this total and we can attach
children

132
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:33,154
based on level 1 so let's go through
senior

133
00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:36,875
this is the basic structure over this
first

134
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:40,294
fee it's a base it's got a background

135
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:44,990
political empty note here which I mean
totem

136
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:47,118
so in code I'm going to load up the
scene

137
00:08:48,018 --> 00:08:52,837
in effect the node called for them

138
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:57,057
at that node I'm going to tax level on

139
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:00,624
level 1 looks like that

140
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:05,053
so separated out the structure the theme
which is like game

141
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:09,800
with the content too little on which is
just stack

142
00:09:09,008 --> 00:09:13,167
and continuing the stream land

143
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:18,008
I do my game logic I keep using names

144
00:09:18,449 --> 00:09:21,454
in order to value whether or not enough
to totem

145
00:09:21,949 --> 00:09:26,420
this means that artist in that incident
what Dec not mean totem

146
00:09:26,042 --> 00:09:29,761
I'd love to see the don't affect the
scoring game

147
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:33,196
just just a simple example what we
should do

148
00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:36,766
to separate out game logic from the
dealer

149
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:44,279
okay pics

150
00:09:46,081 --> 00:09:46,115
okay

151
00:09:47,015 --> 00:09:52,034
let's recap so you saw spec a template
what we're doing is

152
00:09:52,034 --> 00:09:55,042
we're taking see file which in this case
is my feelers care

153
00:09:56,014 --> 00:09:59,067
and your basic code files from isolates

154
00:09:59,067 --> 00:10:03,083
mice in the a.m I was a free Apple Logic
from the assets

155
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:06,121
the key here season is keyed on archiver

156
00:10:07,021 --> 00:10:11,047
something you might not be familiar with
already you insert

157
00:10:11,047 --> 00:10:15,079
the class replacement in this case part

158
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:18,138
that class my senior class for class
lame

159
00:10:19,038 --> 00:10:22,083
sqft this replaces any reference

160
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:27,150
between inside the scene for with your
own class and to support up

161
00:10:28,005 --> 00:10:32,033
so it's going to be in such a
perspective

162
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:36,129
you see an example motivation here's

163
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:41,096
course get your game running on the
first day how are you know

164
00:10:41,096 --> 00:10:47,112
games fun if you're not playing soak it
up a million for state you want do this

165
00:10:48,012 --> 00:10:49,030
without compromising on

166
00:10:49,003 --> 00:10:54,003
skilled earlier don't rush into it and
set yourself up to iterate

167
00:10:54,003 --> 00:10:55,010
collaboratively

168
00:10:55,037 --> 00:10:59,038
designs from the designer supporters
from the artist coaters

169
00:10:59,047 --> 00:11:04,128
on me all the above so

170
00:11:05,028 --> 00:11:08,047
make a genetic level assertion example

171
00:11:08,047 --> 00:11:11,126
make it simple you designed it to commit
to wear

172
00:11:12,026 --> 00:11:15,093
the general gameplay is gonna happen
what objects interacting with what

173
00:11:15,093 --> 00:11:21,097
add place all the content go through
that shortly

174
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:24,186
a competitor action so this is you as a
coder

175
00:11:25,086 --> 00:11:29,086
and the designer working out when it
records from it to be there it again was

176
00:11:29,086 --> 00:11:29,148
working

177
00:11:30,048 --> 00:11:34,062
and then of course easiest part of to so

178
00:11:34,062 --> 00:11:37,066
finish the game alright said

179
00:11:38,002 --> 00:11:42,033
make your to next level this should be
logically up only

180
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:45,044
so if you don't have the art work right
now don't worry about

181
00:11:45,044 --> 00:11:49,069
place markers what you think conference
meant to go

182
00:11:49,069 --> 00:11:52,126
so if you have action going from left to
right well

183
00:11:53,026 --> 00:11:57,060
struck UCLA please mark as we think the
heroes going to begin

184
00:11:57,006 --> 00:12:01,042
name Mr Trujillo place market for you
think enemies are gonna start out in

185
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:01,150
seem

186
00:12:02,005 --> 00:12:05,101
pollen in the NE and any logically
enough

187
00:12:06,046 --> 00:12:10,112
for just platforms on the the background
when measuring Opportunity Act that the

188
00:12:11,012 --> 00:12:14,024
in the background when you move on

189
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:18,107
you place on the content is often what
we called red boxing

190
00:12:19,007 --> 00:12:22,008
so pick a colour

191
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:27,066
but you like for your heroes blue
perhaps is perfect at them

192
00:12:27,066 --> 00:12:30,095
colored sprite nodes don't bother will
text you right now

193
00:12:30,095 --> 00:12:33,103
just put them in the right spot right
size

194
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:37,086
is the key to your artist but you saying
I want this to be

195
00:12:37,086 --> 00:12:40,095
roughly the size over here like this
artist going on the cruise yet

196
00:12:41,076 --> 00:12:44,145
okay now make her

197
00:12:45,045 --> 00:12:49,084
Childress ca2+ soap ArticleMS locations
if you're making a train game

198
00:12:49,084 --> 00:12:52,173
is highly likely that's ok is gonna
clouds look back

199
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:57,091
and that's what should probably leave
with the train set that up as a parent

200
00:12:57,091 --> 00:12:57,178
child relationship

201
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:01,100
next up

202
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,021
hook up the attractions so this is the
past

203
00:13:05,021 --> 00:13:08,029
where you're going through the physical
attraction from the sure they're right

204
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:11,084
so for example if obviously topple over

205
00:13:11,084 --> 00:13:14,135
argument to stay absolutely put on the
hit by

206
00:13:15,035 --> 00:13:18,091
hammer for sale sort out the collision
of

207
00:13:18,091 --> 00:13:22,125
which are determined to track which and
make sure it's in like this

208
00:13:23,025 --> 00:13:28,087
right within the scope right from the
start the league game logic working

209
00:13:28,087 --> 00:13:32,089
and this is really in this lets you see
lodging in large together so you using

210
00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:33,146
those names that you set up in seen

211
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:37,058
you hooking them up to search code
within your

212
00:13:37,058 --> 00:13:40,075
actual game code and

213
00:13:40,075 --> 00:13:43,080
we had a placeholder inside the sample
before

214
00:13:44,025 --> 00:13:48,104
with totem we loaded the level seen in a
place that where the totem empty locator

215
00:13:49,004 --> 00:13:49,039
was

216
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:54,045
this is where you wanna do that so

217
00:13:54,045 --> 00:13:57,079
here's a sample of me having the scene
structure following

218
00:13:57,079 --> 00:14:01,166
on one side little secret on the right
and I'm just making sure that I

219
00:14:02,066 --> 00:14:08,055
Michael matters what I think the
structures so

220
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:12,570
of course just taking up the probably
not gonna make you gain great and fun

221
00:14:12,057 --> 00:14:16,135
you can make sure those to him what its
need to be doing and they've got units

222
00:14:17,035 --> 00:14:17,123
that floated

223
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:21,097
scores and similar things there to lodge
complaints

224
00:14:21,097 --> 00:14:25,086
within you seem to do this is one which
is on first load

225
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:30,002
which called in it with coder and is
going to get called automatically

226
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:33,620
by the key to knock over second one is

227
00:14:33,062 --> 00:14:36,101
did move to you and this is when you
present yet as

228
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:41,570
seen on the rescue solar

229
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:46,100
jump into the details that so on first
load as a set automatically

230
00:14:46,001 --> 00:14:49,059
called by a mosquito not cover as
reloading fight Chordata

231
00:14:49,068 --> 00:14:54,347
sound for example AI or any unit stats
are gonna change

232
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,047
it's called in a coder make sure you go
super in it

233
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:01,880
in it with coated depending upon we
should pick of the

234
00:15:01,088 --> 00:15:04,144
and load up the enemy stats here had
sliders and

235
00:15:05,044 --> 00:15:08,097
a slurry from Felix very simple as the
one-liner

236
00:15:08,097 --> 00:15:12,180
next up you can move to Europe

237
00:15:13,008 --> 00:15:17,010
on first shown in the slices point this
is Colin SK view

238
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:21,221
present scene is called with your scene
and this is a great place to cash your

239
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:22,850
visual elements

240
00:15:22,085 --> 00:15:25,092
so SBC is gonna

241
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:28,141
it loaded by the King archiver and all
the visual elements

242
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:32,119
PNG's the reference again the allotted
well before you get to hear

243
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:37,048
so you can actually be quite a bit of
work inside new to you

244
00:15:37,048 --> 00:15:41,101
without worrying about a lotta loading
costly things if you have a lot of

245
00:15:42,001 --> 00:15:43,440
visual on its a contract with

246
00:15:43,449 --> 00:15:47,110
catch them right here in this case I'm
finding all the enemies

247
00:15:47,011 --> 00:15:50,011
and unseemly in Miami re

248
00:15:50,011 --> 00:15:55,063
some motivation

249
00:15:55,063 --> 00:15:58,098
for doing this the site you want to have

250
00:15:58,098 --> 00:16:01,185
a simple way taking a logical com1

251
00:16:02,085 --> 00:16:06,118
and have a lot to code they're two
different methods for searching

252
00:16:07,018 --> 00:16:12,104
child node name fursuit for finding a
filament and enumerate child nodes

253
00:16:13,004 --> 00:16:17,101
with name from I'll and test results I
really cast

254
00:16:18,001 --> 00:16:22,086
you saw

255
00:16:22,086 --> 00:16:26,088
in the previous lives just a quick can
Research Center

256
00:16:26,088 --> 00:16:31,088
might not have been parent to you first
we have an extra

257
00:16:31,088 --> 00:16:35,180
style search you seen which this case
will slash slash

258
00:16:36,008 --> 00:16:39,647
any what that means is fine

259
00:16:40,439 --> 00:16:44,420
all enemies from the router personally
down

260
00:16:44,042 --> 00:16:48,701
examples here hero which is find a child
called here without

261
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:53,300
percy flashlights hero would find all
the notes and hero

262
00:16:53,003 --> 00:16:58,852
in riker's order we can also search by
class not a single class

263
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:02,217
sickness last session with the node fun
all the middle notes

264
00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:06,130
in your city and you could also use

265
00:17:06,013 --> 00:17:09,842
club style partial matches such as the
wild card here

266
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:14,030
where it's anything any known named
starting with P

267
00:17:14,669 --> 00:17:19,350
super powerful and this is going to be
your best way lodging up

268
00:17:19,035 --> 00:17:22,040
of hooking up your logical seen with the
actual game code

269
00:17:22,004 --> 00:17:26,543
and obviously that's what we did

270
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:31,090
in the sample so before you can see
child not remain

271
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:34,012
being used extensively find it objects
within the scene

272
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:38,075
inside the gate code is very fast you
can do it often

273
00:17:38,075 --> 00:17:41,152
but we do recommend cash results if

274
00:17:42,052 --> 00:17:46,136
it possible from but last step on this
great loss over the phone

275
00:17:47,036 --> 00:17:50,037
easy they'll is the game

276
00:17:50,037 --> 00:17:53,065
that's totally up to you course at the
artwork

277
00:17:53,065 --> 00:17:56,464
you can then replace the Texas red boxes

278
00:17:57,049 --> 00:18:02,290
hopefully artist delivered them at the
right size at levels that you need

279
00:18:02,029 --> 00:18:05,034
which should be easy for the point at
any effect

280
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:09,086
Norman showed you how easy this at
Cedars two things because he's Korean

281
00:18:09,086 --> 00:18:10,125
midfielder Sulley affect not

282
00:18:11,025 --> 00:18:15,046
at that special image post-processing
effect and of course

283
00:18:15,046 --> 00:18:19,108
play test iterate I can't stress this
enough and

284
00:18:20,008 --> 00:18:23,025
have fun this is again is all about

285
00:18:23,025 --> 00:18:26,584
sure you have been following me again
okay

286
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:29,844
when we head over to Nick now to talk
about forest prospectuses

287
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:37,159
pixels of a shock

288
00:18:39,058 --> 00:18:43,104
am today i wanna talk about my two
favorite things

289
00:18:44,004 --> 00:18:47,053
an but two of my favorite things one
which is

290
00:18:47,053 --> 00:18:50,151
improving performance and order to
squeeze down the amount of time that

291
00:18:51,051 --> 00:18:52,057
your game takes to

292
00:18:52,057 --> 00:18:55,123
execute six times a second and then
increasing

293
00:18:56,023 --> 00:18:59,057
the awesome that you can squeeze into
that space that you made by improving

294
00:18:59,057 --> 00:19:01,134
your performance

295
00:19:02,034 --> 00:19:05,051
so I have a bunch of topics to go
through an

296
00:19:05,051 --> 00:19:08,079
to stir quickly give you a preview and
talk about

297
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:11,127
understanding what is involved in drying
where the

298
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:15,436
time is gonna go in a taco actions and
constraints

299
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,800
how their secret window into the
underlying

300
00:19:18,008 --> 00:19:22,074
spray can Jen an physics there's a cost
hierarchy theirs is very helpful to

301
00:19:23,046 --> 00:19:24,057
understand

302
00:19:24,057 --> 00:19:27,132
similarly for shape nodes talk a little
bit about a fax

303
00:19:28,032 --> 00:19:34,055
and some good to know facts about are
lighting systems

304
00:19:34,055 --> 00:19:38,063
so drying performance

305
00:19:39,035 --> 00:19:43,077
Christian things that impact your John
performance

306
00:19:43,077 --> 00:19:46,151
in a big big way 1 is there

307
00:19:47,051 --> 00:19:51,710
choice dry order how it is make your
sprites to the engine

308
00:19:52,169 --> 00:19:55,580
and to years sharing the resources

309
00:19:55,058 --> 00:19:58,086
thirty years to accomplish that drying
now

310
00:19:58,086 --> 00:20:03,145
spray kit has by default

311
00:20:04,045 --> 00:20:09,080
a sibling order drop rule which plants
that standard painters under them

312
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:12,065
there's two roles your parent to paint
us first

313
00:20:13,037 --> 00:20:16,726
very curses down and draws the children
and their children and so on

314
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:22,210
as it goes children are rendered in the
order that the appear in the child away

315
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:25,053
now in this diagram here obviously the
helicopter

316
00:20:25,053 --> 00:20:28,148
has got its very bottom missiles dan the
body in on

317
00:20:29,048 --> 00:20:32,051
and the rotors and its straightforward

318
00:20:32,078 --> 00:20:35,607
to create this in code just by adding
the various parts

319
00:20:36,309 --> 00:20:39,340
now this is very convenient for

320
00:20:39,034 --> 00:20:43,045
prototyping but what is it due to drying
performance

321
00:20:43,045 --> 00:20:46,133
so here's my amazing game scene

322
00:20:47,033 --> 00:20:52,382
and its can have a bunch helicopters and

323
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:56,330
the each peace as we workers down to
draw order

324
00:20:56,033 --> 00:20:59,612
comes an one at a time followed rock all

325
00:20:59,909 --> 00:21:03,490
and for individual dropped calls you
take some time

326
00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:06,056
and you get the idea Field mall in there
now

327
00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:10,022
let's break it gives you in order to
avoid this problem

328
00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:15,208
years the magical

329
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:19,020
third dimension so

330
00:21:19,002 --> 00:21:22,010
let's have a look at what we can do with
that if

331
00:21:22,001 --> 00:21:26,028
we sat ignore sibling order to yes

332
00:21:26,037 --> 00:21:29,071
which means death to control order

333
00:21:29,071 --> 00:21:32,104
that's gonna be pretty helpful so we've
got a helicopter re organ arbitrarily

334
00:21:33,004 --> 00:21:33,088
set it on

335
00:21:33,088 --> 00:21:37,123
level 100 let's stretch out the rotors
in

336
00:21:38,023 --> 00:21:42,028
pulled him towards the camera an at
level 1

337
00:21:42,073 --> 00:21:45,155
now was pushed missiles back like that

338
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:49,080
so now the stock now

339
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:52,074
spray kit knows what you intended with
your composite

340
00:21:53,046 --> 00:21:56,109
it's not based on the order was added in
code or anything like that it's based on

341
00:21:57,009 --> 00:21:58,013
something absolutely

342
00:21:58,013 --> 00:22:01,017
which is where is my current space

343
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:04,064
so does that do for drying

344
00:22:04,064 --> 00:22:07,823
well bit by bit you can see that we've
got

345
00:22:08,399 --> 00:22:11,451
a lot less struggles because we're done
already so that's

346
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:15,470
great and you've got a whole bunch
performance back right away

347
00:22:15,047 --> 00:22:20,626
especially have lots of objects but you
can go further course

348
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:25,540
use texture analysis so here I put all
of the sprite Fanta

349
00:22:25,054 --> 00:22:29,075
one texture and house I can help me

350
00:22:29,075 --> 00:22:33,134
well here's my magical Union force
helicopters

351
00:22:33,809 --> 00:22:36,960
and boom I'm done spray kit can

352
00:22:36,096 --> 00:22:40,100
know that's one texture knows what order
all the bits have to be drawn an

353
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,059
he's bashing a lot for the Jeep UN
blasted on out

354
00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:49,095
an potentially of one single call that's
pretty awesome

355
00:22:49,095 --> 00:22:52,180
now this whole bunch of other things
that can be shared

356
00:22:53,008 --> 00:22:56,039
and should be aware of those things we
have

357
00:22:57,011 --> 00:23:00,047
and you normal map generation scheme and

358
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:03,456
you can see that their arsenal flower
block an

359
00:23:03,879 --> 00:23:07,190
because spray kit textures keyed of a
name

360
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:11,022
an and normal maps were generated
on-the-fly

361
00:23:11,049 --> 00:23:15,058
and with out a name and just to find
somewhere if you can ease that normal

362
00:23:15,058 --> 00:23:15,063
map

363
00:23:16,008 --> 00:23:19,021
on the block you need to know let the
engine now that its

364
00:23:19,021 --> 00:23:22,230
genuinely shared thing so generate

365
00:23:22,419 --> 00:23:26,300
your normal map start on attack sure in
a sign that tax roll this breakthrough

366
00:23:26,003 --> 00:23:26,098
any user

367
00:23:27,025 --> 00:23:32,033
as opposed to you every time we have
that block asking for it to be generated

368
00:23:32,033 --> 00:23:35,128
similarly we've got some cool procedural
nice which might like

369
00:23:36,028 --> 00:23:39,677
like to use initiators sir to provide
some serve you know television star

370
00:23:39,929 --> 00:23:40,976
factor something like that

371
00:23:41,399 --> 00:23:44,530
if you can reuse the noise at the scale
that you've generated

372
00:23:44,053 --> 00:23:47,192
cashed out of because every night
structure that you make is gonna consume

373
00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:49,230
memory and once again

374
00:23:49,023 --> 00:23:53,023
break it won't know unless if you tell
it by sharing a variable in a

375
00:23:53,023 --> 00:23:56,028
cash winter somewhere that yet it is
actually the same texture now

376
00:23:56,028 --> 00:24:00,137
and you won't be able to batch

377
00:24:00,389 --> 00:24:03,980
couple of other some more points if you
reference shooters from files

378
00:24:03,098 --> 00:24:06,497
spray kit will now that were textile FSH

379
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:11,700
is for texts or FSH everywhere you
reference a so when you're prototyping

380
00:24:11,007 --> 00:24:14,186
its often very convenient to reference
cheaters from strings

381
00:24:14,879 --> 00:24:17,600
so go ahead and do that during
prototyping let's break it doesn't

382
00:24:17,006 --> 00:24:19,091
really have any way of knowing that
genuinely these two shooters the same

383
00:24:20,045 --> 00:24:21,974
even though the source code might be the
same

384
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:25,750
if you reference it from a file going
into account to Premium houses

385
00:24:25,075 --> 00:24:29,107
beforehand just cash it all off and its
gonna go that much faster

386
00:24:30,007 --> 00:24:33,031
because if all those helicopters have
the same sheer once again

387
00:24:33,031 --> 00:24:36,096
it knows it's just passed them off like
that and then

388
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:39,128
finally slightly esoteric point on
bashing your is

389
00:24:40,028 --> 00:24:43,082
we offer a number of planned modes
searchers an

390
00:24:43,082 --> 00:24:46,086
additive for multiplicative or whatever

391
00:24:46,086 --> 00:24:49,171
because changing a planned no changes
the GP state

392
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:54,083
we have to actually interrupt the drying
every tiny change that state

393
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:57,162
in order to allow the buying to occur so
trick you can use

394
00:24:58,062 --> 00:25:01,097
you can imagine for example if you had
some sort of a misty forest scene for

395
00:25:01,097 --> 00:25:01,101
layer

396
00:25:02,037 --> 00:25:05,071
treason and layers creatures in a not
earlier

397
00:25:05,071 --> 00:25:08,134
trees in the trees have alpha and I'm if
you put all those things

398
00:25:09,034 --> 00:25:12,069
on the same Z like literally exactly the
same Z

399
00:25:12,069 --> 00:25:15,147
let's break it will know these things go
together with their black and mild

400
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:19,047
and for example olive trees in the front
can go out

401
00:25:19,047 --> 00:25:22,226
in one drop call with 11 mode and that

402
00:25:22,649 --> 00:25:27,260
may or may not be just that will extra
bit you needed to get a little more time

403
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:30,079
to squeeze in that little more awesome

404
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:34,131
now their stools to help you evaluate
graphics performance

405
00:25:35,031 --> 00:25:39,070
so you don't just need to have Lake I'm
serious mental model if these things

406
00:25:39,007 --> 00:25:42,019
an there's actual you know

407
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:45,171
quantitative things you can do you to
get some insight into what's break is

408
00:25:46,071 --> 00:25:48,158
doing behind the scenes

409
00:25:49,058 --> 00:25:52,637
the first ball there's a number of flags

410
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:56,850
on the view which you can turn on and
off in order to get some

411
00:25:56,085 --> 00:25:59,127
insight there's a obvious frame counter

412
00:26:00,027 --> 00:26:03,055
FBS frames per second there's a draw
count

413
00:26:03,055 --> 00:26:07,107
which is actually gonna tell you how
many batches did I get

414
00:26:08,007 --> 00:26:11,606
an there is your note count which is how
many

415
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:15,220
ask a light spray kit nodes actually
went down the pipeline

416
00:26:15,022 --> 00:26:18,079
and finally the five-count if you're
using something like a shape that might

417
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:19,083
be comprised

418
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:22,086
have multiple sub quads

419
00:26:22,086 --> 00:26:25,095
so its gonna tell you that and I have

420
00:26:26,076 --> 00:26:30,087
just quick little thing here to show you
that I have all these gears

421
00:26:30,087 --> 00:26:34,100
an it's showing 12 nodes you'd have to
inspect my scene graph to discover why

422
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,094
there's 12

423
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:38,333
but there's six years you can probably
guess sort of what might be going on

424
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:40,070
there

425
00:26:40,007 --> 00:26:43,076
the heck of a lot of quads like really a
lot

426
00:26:43,076 --> 00:26:46,735
have 12 draws but it's running at 60
frames a second so

427
00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:53,830
I'm pretty happy with that right now
from my magical your game

428
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:57,182
so the other thing you've got is that G
of RAM

429
00:26:57,929 --> 00:27:00,978
Joe friend better so there's all kinds
of cool gauges

430
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:04,515
an tell you what proportion of this and
that is happening striker frame

431
00:27:05,379 --> 00:27:09,290
and I'll give you some insight into what
y'all calls being invoked on fly

432
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:12,097
an had a lot of documentation
information %uh this is a really

433
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:13,526
fantastic tool

434
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:17,450
for understanding the runtime
characteristics of your game

435
00:27:17,045 --> 00:27:21,254
nope notice as you run this thing what's
going on in the hardware

436
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:25,210
and correspondent what's going on in
your game and study that

437
00:27:25,021 --> 00:27:29,105
I'll give you did insight into but the
engine is going for you

438
00:27:30,005 --> 00:27:34,594
so to kinda rolled out a lot

439
00:27:34,639 --> 00:27:38,530
the idea here is pose your seems as
layers

440
00:27:38,053 --> 00:27:42,912
Commons the values are gonna help you a
lot for reasons I mentioned

441
00:27:43,389 --> 00:27:46,500
overlapping things in different layers
order control

442
00:27:46,005 --> 00:27:49,154
the draw order instead of using the
sibling order

443
00:27:49,649 --> 00:27:53,460
an something andrea's share your stuff

444
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:57,102
line modes go together and use the
hudson profilers turd

445
00:27:58,002 --> 00:28:02,021
really understand but the engine is
going

446
00:28:02,021 --> 00:28:05,440
alright next up actions and constraints

447
00:28:05,629 --> 00:28:08,630
as I mentioned and in the introduction

448
00:28:08,639 --> 00:28:12,050
cool thing about actions is they really
are

449
00:28:12,005 --> 00:28:16,080
and magic window into the very got spray
kit execution engine

450
00:28:16,008 --> 00:28:19,063
deep down inside we continuously improve
the performance

451
00:28:20,035 --> 00:28:23,334
other various operations to spray kit
provides

452
00:28:23,649 --> 00:28:27,820
actions Rd little objective-c things
that might think

453
00:28:27,082 --> 00:28:31,100
that might be heavy but it's not it
really cute such instructions for the

454
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,023
execution engine

455
00:28:33,023 --> 00:28:36,060
just couple bites here and there to tell
you what's going to happen

456
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:40,068
and then it puts it off in turn turn
accuse and what not

457
00:28:41,022 --> 00:28:45,221
to run so

458
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:48,750
make an action here I've got an old

459
00:28:48,075 --> 00:28:52,100
and I'm going to rotate by hi parently
for one second

460
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,369
you can change them group down reuse
them

461
00:28:57,369 --> 00:29:01,100
here well airplanes that you may not be
familiar with

462
00:29:01,001 --> 00:29:05,280
and the rotating continuously for a
period of a second

463
00:29:05,379 --> 00:29:08,383
am they're moving around in the scaling

464
00:29:08,419 --> 00:29:12,610
its really simple to set the stuff up
execution engine is ticking

465
00:29:12,061 --> 00:29:16,098
it over its almost re it's great to let
this break engine do stuff for you

466
00:29:16,098 --> 00:29:16,757
rather

467
00:29:17,639 --> 00:29:21,710
encoding it all up in your update so

468
00:29:21,071 --> 00:29:24,098
little bit about sequencing say I've got

469
00:29:24,098 --> 00:29:28,125
something that I have got waiting off
stage left like the secret monster who

470
00:29:29,025 --> 00:29:30,030
make is

471
00:29:30,003 --> 00:29:34,034
parents in less than one second an I can
have it way

472
00:29:34,061 --> 00:29:40,073
and ann milf so that's like a sequence

473
00:29:40,073 --> 00:29:44,462
also man my monster comes might rotate
and scale and feet away

474
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:48,220
he is merely a ghost

475
00:29:48,022 --> 00:29:54,071
so thats the use if I can ask a Action
Group

476
00:29:54,071 --> 00:29:57,104
and then you can compose those things as
deeply in complex

477
00:29:58,004 --> 00:30:04,143
complex Haveli as you like my love to
make up words

478
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:08,960
right so and this case my monsters gonna
move his scale rotate and its gonna fade

479
00:30:08,096 --> 00:30:10,110
away

480
00:30:11,001 --> 00:30:15,045
now St action I teaches your friend is
the documentation here

481
00:30:15,054 --> 00:30:19,060
am like you all to carefully read these
all down

482
00:30:19,006 --> 00:30:22,054
actually go look at the documentation is
a lottt now

483
00:30:23,008 --> 00:30:26,084
there's a ton of power and there's a lot
of fun to play with constraints

484
00:30:26,084 --> 00:30:29,089
and you're here for the previous section
and

485
00:30:30,034 --> 00:30:33,108
non-interest quite well and I have just
got a quick little

486
00:30:34,008 --> 00:30:37,357
summary slide here constraints for
another sang an

487
00:30:37,429 --> 00:30:40,452
which gives you access to the high
performance engine running underneath

488
00:30:40,659 --> 00:30:43,600
break it in this case it's running
inverse kinematics

489
00:30:43,006 --> 00:30:46,041
and this full scene was set up in Xcode
an

490
00:30:46,095 --> 00:30:49,110
very quickly just an looking

491
00:30:50,001 --> 00:30:54,810
and setting up couple grounders

492
00:30:54,909 --> 00:30:57,933
here's another one that's actually new
and cool

493
00:30:58,149 --> 00:31:01,460
and you can create a follow a path now
which seeks to see

494
00:31:01,046 --> 00:31:05,395
after a and if you've ever spent any
time with Betty spines and what not

495
00:31:05,809 --> 00:31:08,840
the math is kinda scary especially
making things move

496
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:12,450
at a uniform speeders particularly hairy
so

497
00:31:12,045 --> 00:31:15,504
if when hadn't given you and ASCII
action to follow a path

498
00:31:15,909 --> 00:31:20,020
along the spine the create account
morons line if you care

499
00:31:20,002 --> 00:31:26,661
an and will move things along at a
constant velocity for you

500
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:29,760
click your

501
00:31:29,076 --> 00:31:33,455
right Korean to node similar sort of
thing

502
00:31:34,139 --> 00:31:37,330
you don't need to bother with York
tangent in a lot sorry thing

503
00:31:37,033 --> 00:31:43,072
the blue balls moving around the arrows
following

504
00:31:43,072 --> 00:31:46,076
and the other really cool thing about
actions

505
00:31:46,076 --> 00:31:49,080
is the kind of blatant in memory when
you create them

506
00:31:49,008 --> 00:31:53,847
build them once take advantage in the
fact that the copy on dad

507
00:31:54,639 --> 00:31:57,730
and that the run when you add it to the
scene mine

508
00:31:57,073 --> 00:32:00,149
example here City might have spaceship
our Monster

509
00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:04,132
its gonna enter from stage left in the
same way every time and maybe follow a

510
00:32:05,032 --> 00:32:06,551
path and then leave

511
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:11,230
if you create that node with the
spaceship and the action

512
00:32:11,023 --> 00:32:14,070
cash in on a pointer and then cokie it

513
00:32:14,007 --> 00:32:17,090
an ad to your scene it'll run every
single time

514
00:32:18,053 --> 00:32:23,148
and exactly the same way very very
little overhead

515
00:32:24,048 --> 00:32:27,075
and another fun thing that's easy to
overlook

516
00:32:27,075 --> 00:32:30,080
is the purpose naming your actions

517
00:32:30,008 --> 00:32:33,127
so in this example here

518
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,937
what I've got is the idea that I have a
spray tan

519
00:32:38,099 --> 00:32:41,107
basically gonna do something like they
follow a touch point

520
00:32:41,179 --> 00:32:45,184
I might run in action that is like move
two points I give it the name

521
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,696
move now I can override that action in
time I want

522
00:32:49,849 --> 00:32:52,970
just by using the same key so it might
be in progress

523
00:32:52,097 --> 00:32:56,098
around the action again with a new point
it'll immediately segue without a hat

524
00:32:56,098 --> 00:32:56,957
your starter

525
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:00,864
onto the new action and continue on and
finally

526
00:33:01,089 --> 00:33:04,770
if I monsters coming in here and then he
saw that I had you know the big monster

527
00:33:04,077 --> 00:33:05,726
re repeller 2000

528
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:09,960
and he decides he doesn't want to go all
the way into the scene

529
00:33:09,096 --> 00:33:12,133
we can just use a move action from key
with his move

530
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:16,042
key and tell counsel that action right
away

531
00:33:16,339 --> 00:33:19,690
and he can go into something else we
don't have to wait for the ex fusion

532
00:33:19,069 --> 00:33:23,758
at play out the ant

533
00:33:24,379 --> 00:33:28,020
right next physics

534
00:33:28,002 --> 00:33:31,054
physics a lot of fun I really really
love

535
00:33:31,054 --> 00:33:35,153
there new simulation tool that we've got
an Xcode because

536
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:38,940
the hardest thing about working with
physics

537
00:33:38,094 --> 00:33:42,106
is getting the parameters right now
which set things up good

538
00:33:43,006 --> 00:33:46,073
defaults for example he said a massive
wine and a strength wanna

539
00:33:46,073 --> 00:33:50,232
on rigid body in a strength one on a
field the gun interacting kind of an

540
00:33:50,889 --> 00:33:52,460
interesting way out as the bad

541
00:33:52,046 --> 00:33:55,485
but that's just the starting point for
your iteration

542
00:33:55,899 --> 00:33:59,968
so rigid bodies are just mentioned ready
should bodies that's all things your

543
00:34:00,589 --> 00:34:00,673
game there

544
00:34:01,429 --> 00:34:04,780
passing falling ruling sliding an

545
00:34:04,078 --> 00:34:07,086
the things that the physics engine has
to do each frame

546
00:34:08,058 --> 00:34:10,126
are you a rigid bodies handling
collisions and letting you know that

547
00:34:11,026 --> 00:34:12,165
they've occurred

548
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:16,030
and physics feels now

549
00:34:16,003 --> 00:34:19,079
a primary thing for getting access to
iteration

550
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:23,638
and understanding what's going on years
the new physics visualizer

551
00:34:24,349 --> 00:34:28,260
so was just go back to mine years came
here I'm

552
00:34:28,026 --> 00:34:31,365
dropping in these wonderful years and

553
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:34,940
wait a second his key for

554
00:34:34,094 --> 00:34:37,107
acting properly what's up with that

555
00:34:38,007 --> 00:34:42,023
the other ones are interlocking just not
that one

556
00:34:42,023 --> 00:34:46,024
so I'll turn on the visualize earning
can see 0

557
00:34:46,024 --> 00:34:49,079
that was a circle I made a mistake
somewhere so I can go

558
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:52,145
your tax code in click on my thang are
its procedural

559
00:34:53,045 --> 00:34:57,069
I can look at my code I can find out why
did this one slip through the cracks

560
00:34:57,069 --> 00:35:00,073
so this is here this is a great first

561
00:35:00,073 --> 00:35:03,099
line of defense for just understanding
what the dynamic behavior is

562
00:35:03,099 --> 00:35:06,120
it's not what you expected you can also
use this mild

563
00:35:07,002 --> 00:35:11,881
for identifying quickly am what is the
cause

564
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:15,930
physics performance issues an object
might be stuck in a wall

565
00:35:15,093 --> 00:35:18,182
and it might be an invisible all because
it was only there is a physics body

566
00:35:19,082 --> 00:35:22,095
now you'll just be able to see that well
it's continuously pushing

567
00:35:22,095 --> 00:35:25,754
in and out of collision encounter escape
and

568
00:35:26,609 --> 00:35:32,510
the next steps to solve that problem
will probably occur to you

569
00:35:32,051 --> 00:35:37,630
so in order to take best advantage in
physics

570
00:35:38,089 --> 00:35:42,540
in order to get performance you can
squeeze down the amount of time spending

571
00:35:42,054 --> 00:35:44,054
key squeeze in more awesome

572
00:35:44,054 --> 00:35:47,055
is to understand the cost hierarchy

573
00:35:47,055 --> 00:35:50,119
first of all dynamic objects

574
00:35:51,019 --> 00:35:54,025
cost more because the clinicians need to
be resolved

575
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,138
and they need to be moved outta
intersection

576
00:35:57,849 --> 00:36:02,220
then objects that are static like
hopefully the stage than standing on

577
00:36:02,022 --> 00:36:05,023
so if you can set an object

578
00:36:05,023 --> 00:36:08,029
dude dynamic equals now

579
00:36:08,029 --> 00:36:12,118
you're gonna get a lot of performance
back right away

580
00:36:13,018 --> 00:36:17,089
at most efficient and at the scale our
circles

581
00:36:17,089 --> 00:36:21,093
you have dozens of circles for every
other kind of shape

582
00:36:22,029 --> 00:36:25,077
that you can have and she circles might
work

583
00:36:25,077 --> 00:36:28,116
really really good for a lot of things
especially if for circular

584
00:36:29,016 --> 00:36:32,090
hurt their small issue not really notice
that the interaction house

585
00:36:32,009 --> 00:36:35,087
circle doesn't fit very well on the
hammer

586
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:40,497
that's a bit better the hammer at least
you know has edges and stuff

587
00:36:41,109 --> 00:36:45,940
this is more expensive down the circle
we could have doesn't the circle sicken

588
00:36:45,094 --> 00:36:48,094
have maybe I don't know eights these
just

589
00:36:48,094 --> 00:36:52,151
will build its leader an polygons a
better

590
00:36:53,051 --> 00:36:57,380
this is probably gonna be and the one
that serves a lot of complicated shapes

591
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:57,914
the best

592
00:36:58,589 --> 00:37:02,710
it's more expensive than a rectangle
because is more edges to compute

593
00:37:02,071 --> 00:37:05,139
camp on objects an

594
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:09,103
need to be iterated through all the way
for all the pieces

595
00:37:10,003 --> 00:37:16,057
lotsa circles compounded are a lot
cheaper than a lot of boxes compounded

596
00:37:16,057 --> 00:37:19,156
and finally there's the an perfect

597
00:37:20,056 --> 00:37:23,095
pixel often ask bodies these

598
00:37:23,095 --> 00:37:27,100
are potentially cheap if it was a circle

599
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,045
going to be cheap actually but if it's
got a convex

600
00:37:31,045 --> 00:37:34,106
a complex convoluted shape and iraqi a
lot of cum

601
00:37:35,006 --> 00:37:39,042
computation involved there so just be
careful with these

602
00:37:39,042 --> 00:37:42,107
you need to pick the representation the
past two starts here

603
00:37:43,007 --> 00:37:48,022
serves your game you might find that the
per pixel thank is actually better

604
00:37:48,022 --> 00:37:52,039
dan having like say twenty will circles
to describe something

605
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:55,064
but prefers things on

606
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:58,095
the fish inside of the charge as much as
he can

607
00:37:58,095 --> 00:38:01,484
serve you can play

608
00:38:02,339 --> 00:38:06,680
alright collision masks is another thing
that you can use

609
00:38:06,068 --> 00:38:09,070
to regain performance

610
00:38:09,088 --> 00:38:13,057
especially in a case like yes I've got
these two jars

611
00:38:13,849 --> 00:38:16,890
late charge my marbles green jar

612
00:38:16,089 --> 00:38:19,808
with green marbles now the funny thing
about this

613
00:38:20,609 --> 00:38:24,900
it's a pretty close together and you
might be hard for the engine to actually

614
00:38:24,009 --> 00:38:25,188
understand

615
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:29,105
that the white marbles have no way
getting in the green journ

616
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:34,210
vice versa see you can help the engine
out

617
00:38:34,021 --> 00:38:39,023
this is what the engine sees like

618
00:38:39,023 --> 00:38:42,041
for everyone others green marbles

619
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:45,118
every one of those white marbles are
they hitting so

620
00:38:46,018 --> 00:38:52,031
just imagine how many comparison site is

621
00:38:52,031 --> 00:38:55,040
putting the jar back again now

622
00:38:55,004 --> 00:38:58,046
if he is a collision mask give the white
marbles

623
00:38:58,082 --> 00:39:02,601
mask wine and a green marbles mask to
you

624
00:39:03,339 --> 00:39:07,341
you're gonna get a halt on a performance
back this is an order and squared

625
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:08,360
problem

626
00:39:08,369 --> 00:39:12,490
and so by cutting the number of
comparisons and half

627
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:15,068
well dude the mouth

628
00:39:15,068 --> 00:39:20,144
a lot of computation that you can get
back just through this temple experience

629
00:39:21,044 --> 00:39:24,113
right none introduced force feels very
nicely in the previous ones I'm not

630
00:39:25,013 --> 00:39:25,055
gonna

631
00:39:25,055 --> 00:39:28,074
and labor what all the different force
fields are in there feels and things

632
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,096
like that

633
00:39:29,096 --> 00:39:32,127
but I am gonna point out an that they're
building blocks

634
00:39:33,027 --> 00:39:36,082
use them together and use actions

635
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:39,100
and to fade in and out have a big nasty

636
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,849
particle system here and what I've done
is just made a whole bunch a force field

637
00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:45,880
throughout the center the screen

638
00:39:45,088 --> 00:39:48,132
and just using an action to modulate the
strength

639
00:39:49,032 --> 00:39:52,117
%uh each force field so they smoothly
said way one into the other

640
00:39:53,017 --> 00:39:56,021
that's a lot nicer than just turning
them on or off an

641
00:39:56,021 --> 00:39:59,100
well I love playing with these things
are mostly at

642
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,003
for that slide n now here's another
example

643
00:40:04,003 --> 00:40:08,032
have how for skills to help you out in
reducing game logic

644
00:40:08,032 --> 00:40:11,093
and simplifying updates similarly to the
way that

645
00:40:11,093 --> 00:40:14,129
the actions 30 window into the engine

646
00:40:15,029 --> 00:40:18,042
force feels are another thing that you
can use

647
00:40:18,042 --> 00:40:21,093
to replace game logic so even

648
00:40:21,093 --> 00:40:24,119
kinda tell without me even telling you
what kind of game this one is going to

649
00:40:25,019 --> 00:40:25,050
be

650
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:29,052
but was just your looks like for second

651
00:40:29,097 --> 00:40:33,100
in Seattle geyser following house cursor
around

652
00:40:34,027 --> 00:40:37,079
and doing their darndest not to run into
those

653
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:41,145
green planet things I guess spacious
nearly as big as a planet that's kind of

654
00:40:42,045 --> 00:40:42,107
amazing

655
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:46,018
an

656
00:40:46,018 --> 00:40:49,081
its hypnotic

657
00:40:49,081 --> 00:40:52,140
okay I think I can stop staring at that
now alright

658
00:40:53,004 --> 00:40:56,042
will wait that's the big reveal let's go
back to the pictures the

659
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:59,079
me if you can or maybe not

660
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:02,898
before I show you that next like an what
I want to tell you

661
00:41:03,609 --> 00:41:06,980
is using Xcode I made that level so

662
00:41:06,098 --> 00:41:09,145
I Houston idea like that I like to call
prefabs

663
00:41:10,045 --> 00:41:13,067
likely fabricated objects to make a
little scene graph

664
00:41:13,067 --> 00:41:17,113
with the spaceships picture and a force
field right underneath it

665
00:41:18,013 --> 00:41:21,472
I gave the force field on the spaceship
a negative strength we push each other

666
00:41:21,589 --> 00:41:22,520
apart

667
00:41:22,052 --> 00:41:25,061
I gave the planet child which is a force
field

668
00:41:26,042 --> 00:41:29,049
with a negative strength so that it
pushes

669
00:41:29,049 --> 00:41:32,094
little space ships away I made the
planet's not dynamic

670
00:41:32,094 --> 00:41:36,483
and I made spaceships dynamic okay now
we can look at that

671
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:40,403
re: so this is the whole entire

672
00:41:41,069 --> 00:41:44,880
that game aside from the bit that I
built in Xcode its

673
00:41:44,088 --> 00:41:48,104
next to nothing and you're getting the
same sort of behavior the scene classic

674
00:41:49,004 --> 00:41:51,011
RTS is like your Starcraft or whatever

675
00:41:51,074 --> 00:41:54,943
so but is doing from top to bottom this
just

676
00:41:55,609 --> 00:41:58,720
the target is where I tap the screen

677
00:41:58,072 --> 00:42:01,148
an my not the ship's position as I'm
calculating

678
00:42:02,048 --> 00:42:06,081
an I don't divide by 0 some checking for
that little minimum length I'm

679
00:42:06,081 --> 00:42:09,096
getting the velocity from the physics
body I'm finding out

680
00:42:09,096 --> 00:42:13,096
what direction the velocity is an will
arc tangent gives me an angled

681
00:42:13,096 --> 00:42:16,125
slap on the rotation

682
00:42:17,025 --> 00:42:20,025
I'm taking the position difference

683
00:42:20,025 --> 00:42:23,080
where I wanna go from where I am
subtracting

684
00:42:23,008 --> 00:42:27,297
the velocity multiplying it by a magic
number

685
00:42:28,089 --> 00:42:31,760
which I arrived at by iterating

686
00:42:31,076 --> 00:42:34,092
and then I just applying an impulse
using

687
00:42:34,092 --> 00:42:38,148
back out with magic number and you
basically get looks like artificial

688
00:42:39,048 --> 00:42:40,079
intelligence

689
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:44,128
for having done nothing at all now gonna
learn more about that stuff you can

690
00:42:45,028 --> 00:42:48,087
like search the internet for blades
there's a

691
00:42:48,339 --> 00:42:51,800
wonderful body of work around these
kinds of techniques

692
00:42:51,008 --> 00:42:55,067
now just like physics debug drying

693
00:42:55,859 --> 00:42:58,860
can give you insight into what's going
on

694
00:42:58,869 --> 00:43:01,893
here's you know the wizard behind the
curtain the

695
00:43:02,109 --> 00:43:06,660
I've turned on the field by drying you
can see the fields around the ship's

696
00:43:06,066 --> 00:43:11,115
the fields around the planet and how
they interact and

697
00:43:12,015 --> 00:43:15,027
I don't know it's a crazy amount of fun
for like 10 minutes coding

698
00:43:15,027 --> 00:43:22,027
so yield of mathematical spaceship games
free download and play

699
00:43:24,004 --> 00:43:27,433
I don't like that's like a way because
I'll just watch forever

700
00:43:27,829 --> 00:43:32,220
okay so physics choose

701
00:43:32,022 --> 00:43:36,031
I don't know which is:--what's gesture
how I had to keep down at the

702
00:43:36,031 --> 00:43:39,043
that side of the screen and she is the
cheapest one

703
00:43:39,043 --> 00:43:42,052
and that scan best serve your game

704
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:45,064
use the expensive ones judiciously to
serve you can play

705
00:43:45,064 --> 00:43:49,783
separate your group with mass see engine
knows what your intent is cuz

706
00:43:50,359 --> 00:43:53,359
that's the only way that it can read
your mind an

707
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:56,730
feels replace up the logic

708
00:43:56,073 --> 00:43:59,075
fuel creative thinking imagination

709
00:43:59,075 --> 00:44:02,077
and the debug drying Skyview all kinds
in sight

710
00:44:02,077 --> 00:44:05,078
into what the engine is doing for a
behind-the-scenes

711
00:44:05,078 --> 00:44:08,167
so my next topic

712
00:44:08,869 --> 00:44:13,810
shapes had little refresher here

713
00:44:13,081 --> 00:44:16,600
on the difference between it now part an

714
00:44:17,329 --> 00:44:23,060
sector UN carry gas which is the factor

715
00:44:23,006 --> 00:44:26,073
now there's a cost iraqi shapes

716
00:44:26,073 --> 00:44:29,932
just like there's a cost hierarchy
physics

717
00:44:30,589 --> 00:44:34,640
you know what I can say they're she's
won Best service again

718
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:38,650
these guys in particular squares

719
00:44:38,065 --> 00:44:42,080
and rectangles are really cheap

720
00:44:42,008 --> 00:44:46,053
I'm to say that sprite are way way way
off

721
00:44:47,025 --> 00:44:51,051
the cheap steel beyond these guys but
not that far off

722
00:44:51,051 --> 00:44:54,088
you can use these things a lot worse
appropriate

723
00:44:54,088 --> 00:44:58,567
these are just a bit more Spencer you
can use them a lot

724
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:04,700
be's have had a tire on love put into
them in this iteration stray cat

725
00:45:04,007 --> 00:45:07,012
an you can dry so many maps in

726
00:45:08,002 --> 00:45:11,031
you know compass roses all kinds of
things like that

727
00:45:11,049 --> 00:45:14,105
with factors that in previous iterations
this break it

728
00:45:15,005 --> 00:45:18,063
you might have had them in the judicious
column now there in the

729
00:45:18,063 --> 00:45:21,090
d-licious column

730
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:25,014
alright stroked Kors now

731
00:45:26,004 --> 00:45:29,673
I wish I could have no hockey sticks to
show you the cost here

732
00:45:30,069 --> 00:45:33,530
the same look really great and

733
00:45:33,053 --> 00:45:36,362
use a few of them and you not gonna
really your performance at all

734
00:45:36,839 --> 00:45:40,040
is by inch now may get a call from on

735
00:45:40,004 --> 00:45:45,013
finally feeling the man costs even more

736
00:45:45,013 --> 00:45:48,020
so as full a bracket there see you now

737
00:45:48,002 --> 00:45:52,007
which is the cheap ass in which is
expensive half use the thing that's

738
00:45:52,025 --> 00:45:55,025
perfect your game

739
00:45:55,025 --> 00:45:58,072
just because I can't stop myself I made
a fractal

740
00:45:58,072 --> 00:46:02,075
space point curving with tens of
thousands

741
00:46:02,075 --> 00:46:05,103
points in at an just kinda say

742
00:46:06,003 --> 00:46:10,004
K they're cheap use them

743
00:46:10,004 --> 00:46:13,013
alright affect notes use

744
00:46:13,013 --> 00:46:16,462
a fag nodes when you want to have a
subtree

745
00:46:16,579 --> 00:46:20,650
sprites or whatever that our goal going
to gather

746
00:46:20,065 --> 00:46:23,119
how some kind of a fact apply to them
such as

747
00:46:24,019 --> 00:46:28,056
tenting or blurring

748
00:46:28,056 --> 00:46:31,057
they have to be drawn off screen and
then

749
00:46:31,066 --> 00:46:34,113
brought back to the frame buffer for
feeling so

750
00:46:35,013 --> 00:46:38,050
there's a cost you can get me

751
00:46:38,005 --> 00:46:41,057
powerful car image support even run

752
00:46:42,002 --> 00:46:46,068
very sophisticated filters an all kinds
of amazing things

753
00:46:46,068 --> 00:46:51,081
by its expansive use them when you need
to

754
00:46:51,081 --> 00:46:54,600
shade urs are an awesome option

755
00:46:55,329 --> 00:46:59,140
whenever you don't need to have things
composited

756
00:46:59,014 --> 00:47:02,051
off-screen particularly a can just go
ahead and rock

757
00:47:02,051 --> 00:47:05,124
shares will save your performance bacon

758
00:47:06,024 --> 00:47:09,075
if you want to just tent everything
green that's a really simple shaker

759
00:47:09,075 --> 00:47:12,151
you just bypass you know the whole
processing stock just go

760
00:47:13,051 --> 00:47:17,116
right now to the hardware so learn about
that

761
00:47:18,016 --> 00:47:21,044
an should Rasta rise just

762
00:47:21,044 --> 00:47:24,223
gives us a hand about what can be cashed
in hangin'

763
00:47:24,619 --> 00:47:27,619
will hang around for a while and what
needs to be be composited

764
00:47:27,619 --> 00:47:31,280
every screen

765
00:47:31,028 --> 00:47:34,051
if you've got things that are going to
be static for a while

766
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:38,055
for example maybe you've got some kinda
had displayed only updates once every 10

767
00:47:38,055 --> 00:47:39,061
seconds but you might have

768
00:47:40,015 --> 00:47:43,042
you know and cool glows and blurs and

769
00:47:43,042 --> 00:47:46,043
real starts in all kinds of things going
on

770
00:47:46,052 --> 00:47:49,143
last redoubt there's a couple of cool
things he can do here

771
00:47:50,043 --> 00:47:53,202
you can create a texture from an old an
just

772
00:47:53,589 --> 00:47:57,800
specify the note ask give you a raster
for United gotta textures slap that up

773
00:47:57,008 --> 00:47:59,327
soon cost almost nothing

774
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:05,190
have CI filter there's the other and
writer

775
00:48:05,829 --> 00:48:09,160
right that's what I have to say about a
fax

776
00:48:09,016 --> 00:48:12,975
now for lighting

777
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:16,143
we have sung introduction from Norman in
the last section about lighting

778
00:48:16,359 --> 00:48:19,381
sign a talk about the performance cost
so

779
00:48:19,579 --> 00:48:22,626
the first thing that you need to now is
a

780
00:48:23,049 --> 00:48:26,049
well we're gonna compete the lighting
per pixel

781
00:48:26,049 --> 00:48:29,053
so the cost is there for proportional to
the amount

782
00:48:29,089 --> 00:48:33,660
like blue pixels you can optimize that
with

783
00:48:33,066 --> 00:48:36,119
it now if you say some things are going
to be wet

784
00:48:37,019 --> 00:48:40,848
thing and I can pay that cost so that's
what that's all about

785
00:48:41,019 --> 00:48:47,070
and the inlay is free

786
00:48:47,529 --> 00:48:50,583
you can have eight light for sprite

787
00:48:51,069 --> 00:48:54,120
now your to pay for you know eight times
the processing

788
00:48:54,579 --> 00:48:59,582
per pixel spray so way if you want to do
that

789
00:48:59,609 --> 00:49:02,690
and keep the cost down with that now

790
00:49:02,069 --> 00:49:06,143
normal maps archie she did you see sews
up so

791
00:49:07,043 --> 00:49:12,116
stick on maps on they'll agree remember
to share them

792
00:49:13,016 --> 00:49:16,020
shadows are cost

793
00:49:16,002 --> 00:49:19,851
proportional to the number of flights
it's pretty much constand

794
00:49:20,049 --> 00:49:23,490
so if you turn on one shadow that's
gonna cost you

795
00:49:23,049 --> 00:49:26,068
wine to shadows is in a cost you to you

796
00:49:26,068 --> 00:49:30,089
so keep the number of those things down

797
00:49:30,089 --> 00:49:33,163
you potentially have to shadow the whole
entire screen

798
00:49:34,063 --> 00:49:38,732
so they look really great you can add a
lot of impact an awesome

799
00:49:39,299 --> 00:49:43,324
use them don't abuse and

800
00:49:43,549 --> 00:49:46,960
alright so we talked about

801
00:49:46,096 --> 00:49:49,113
drying performance understand what

802
00:49:50,013 --> 00:49:53,015
controls batching and dry order

803
00:49:53,015 --> 00:49:58,364
an learn about the tools to get insight
into what's going on

804
00:49:58,499 --> 00:50:02,554
actions and constraints are your window
into this break it down Jan

805
00:50:03,049 --> 00:50:06,400
we improve the efficiency all the time
the more you use actions

806
00:50:06,004 --> 00:50:09,009
the more you're gonna get performance
back over time this week generate

807
00:50:09,045 --> 00:50:12,364
frameworks physics

808
00:50:12,769 --> 00:50:17,803
understand the cost iraqi choose
appropriately to serve you can play

809
00:50:18,109 --> 00:50:22,670
same with shapes a fax understand the
cost

810
00:50:22,067 --> 00:50:27,746
use them wisely and lighting is a cheap
easy way to extra awesome

811
00:50:28,349 --> 00:50:32,425
and i'd like y'all maker games awesome
as possible

812
00:50:33,109 --> 00:50:36,174
right so today

813
00:50:36,759 --> 00:50:40,680
we talked about structure and games for
scalability

814
00:50:40,068 --> 00:50:43,437
understanding how to setup scene graphs

815
00:50:44,049 --> 00:50:48,125
and scene graph snippets the can put
things together in a data-driven way

816
00:50:48,809 --> 00:50:51,878
and we talked a whole bunch about
performance

817
00:50:52,499 --> 00:50:56,556
for more information encourage you to
contact Allen Schaeffer

818
00:50:57,069 --> 00:51:01,440
and Philip yes Q who are a games
evangelist

819
00:51:01,044 --> 00:51:04,383
spring kit programming guide recently
refresh has a tiny interesting

820
00:51:04,779 --> 00:51:06,180
information and

821
00:51:06,018 --> 00:51:09,021
and of course there's always the forms

822
00:51:09,048 --> 00:51:13,049
and tomorrow i'd love did he call come
visit us in

823
00:51:13,049 --> 00:51:17,067
the labs an talk about what you've got
going on in

824
00:51:17,067 --> 00:51:20,114
you know say hi and with that

825
00:51:21,014 --> 00:51:24,040
and thanks very much and I'll see ya
later
