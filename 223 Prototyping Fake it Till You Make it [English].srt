1
00:00:12,027 --> 00:00:16,061
good morning everybody

2
00:00:16,061 --> 00:00:16,990
welcome

3
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:18,750
I think

4
00:00:18,075 --> 00:00:22,075
referencing I Prada long-winded on
Julian mythic

5
00:00:22,075 --> 00:00:25,150
and Mark Allan Stein from a team ok with
this session for today

6
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:29,054
wealth for developers the company chopin

7
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:32,668
act when to be expected

8
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:37,260
solar developers alright

9
00:00:37,026 --> 00:00:40,053
people who don't coated all anyone

10
00:00:40,053 --> 00:00:43,116
alright great very review

11
00:00:44,016 --> 00:00:48,058
and designers designer

12
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:52,125
yeah I all right and management I'd

13
00:00:53,025 --> 00:00:57,040
I

14
00:00:57,004 --> 00:00:58,080
third out you guys yeah

15
00:00:59,016 --> 00:01:02,065
your plan today

16
00:01:02,065 --> 00:01:07,089
we're gonna design and prototyping ap
we're gonna go through the steps we

17
00:01:07,089 --> 00:01:11,137
would go through to try something out
and we're gonna show you a variety of

18
00:01:12,037 --> 00:01:15,105
different prototyping map it all day

19
00:01:16,005 --> 00:01:21,024
it can be with focus on prototyping
experience not trying on API are testing

20
00:01:21,024 --> 00:01:22,115
out some kind of technical feasibility

21
00:01:23,015 --> 00:01:26,034
so who are we

22
00:01:26,034 --> 00:01:29,082
here we come here and tell you how to
make your apt

23
00:01:29,082 --> 00:01:32,169
well worth mall secret team at Apple we
work across

24
00:01:33,069 --> 00:01:37,074
all about this product we explore what
new interfaces

25
00:01:37,074 --> 00:01:40,563
mean to our devices operating system and
application

26
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:45,190
and we do this by making interactive
prototypes

27
00:01:45,019 --> 00:01:48,338
everyday sometimes 24 hours a day

28
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:52,170
said today

29
00:01:52,017 --> 00:01:57,021
you're all very lucky I'm gonna unveiled

30
00:01:57,057 --> 00:02:00,152
all love you today a world-changing

31
00:02:01,052 --> 00:02:04,140
disruptive application

32
00:02:05,004 --> 00:02:08,473
and I'd like to show it to you

33
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:15,869
right now

34
00:02:27,017 --> 00:02:30,101
different application to explore and
discover artisanal Coast

35
00:02:31,001 --> 00:02:35,064
on the streets of San Francisco browse
for toasted near you

36
00:02:35,064 --> 00:02:38,273
find a poptart in town

37
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:42,913
going to get food to go share the toast
with your friend

38
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:47,700
take a picture

39
00:02:47,007 --> 00:02:50,040
share with your friends or loved one
today

40
00:02:51,003 --> 00:02:56,079
I give to you ladies and gentlemen
post-modern

41
00:02:56,079 --> 00:03:03,079
thank you thank you everyone

42
00:03:04,024 --> 00:03:05,063
and it's available now

43
00:03:05,063 --> 00:03:08,158
to go and get a except if not

44
00:03:09,058 --> 00:03:13,085
none of this is real it's just a
prototype

45
00:03:13,085 --> 00:03:17,085
so why why we go to the trouble

46
00:03:17,085 --> 00:03:20,170
creating this beautiful world-changing

47
00:03:21,007 --> 00:03:24,015
disruptive application that is
completely fake

48
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:28,078
well this is the picture and most people
had

49
00:03:29,023 --> 00:03:33,088
I have an idea then

50
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:37,090
I build my application then

51
00:03:38,008 --> 00:03:44,040
step 3: profit

52
00:03:44,004 --> 00:03:47,059
except when I see frequently is that

53
00:03:47,095 --> 00:03:50,164
people have an idea the builder
application

54
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:54,081
and somehow they're disappointed by the
result

55
00:03:54,081 --> 00:03:58,930
maybe the experiences and what you hope
for

56
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:03,703
maybe just doesn't resonate with your
customers and building applications are

57
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:07,138
difficult you guys know this takes time

58
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:11,280
take money people

59
00:04:11,028 --> 00:04:14,637
sleep hard a

60
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:20,370
and frankly a blood-typing so that want
to work for something

61
00:04:20,037 --> 00:04:24,836
but you're not happy with me and so
instead of going from the idea

62
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:29,090
directly to building our application
we're gonna go from the idea

63
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:36,009
to a prototype in Van Gelder application
and its best if we can do that

64
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:43,630
over and over again the more prototypes
we can put between our idea

65
00:04:43,063 --> 00:04:47,075
in her application the better the result
is going to be

66
00:04:47,075 --> 00:04:51,087
and we we do this is by beginning with
something fake

67
00:04:51,087 --> 00:04:54,168
and then gradually adding elements that
are more real

68
00:04:55,068 --> 00:05:01,027
along the way sprinkling it with
interactivity so they're too important

69
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:04,030
reasons to prototype want everybody to
keep in mind

70
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:07,005
threat today number one

71
00:05:07,005 --> 00:05:10,027
if the test ideas to save time and money

72
00:05:10,027 --> 00:05:14,080
building the right things for your
application number two

73
00:05:14,008 --> 00:05:17,089
is to get new ideas to make the
experience up your ap

74
00:05:18,061 --> 00:05:22,133
even better Emir so how do we do that

75
00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:28,742
actually really simple makes a cap

76
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:34,074
show people and learn from their
feedback

77
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:38,550
again make fake ap

78
00:05:38,055 --> 00:05:43,127
show people and learn from their
feedback

79
00:05:44,027 --> 00:05:49,053
do that over and over and over again
until the experience severe

80
00:05:49,053 --> 00:05:55,372
out feels great so how do we make fake
gaps for them

81
00:05:55,849 --> 00:05:58,928
well after self three questions before
we begin

82
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:02,714
the first one is what needs to be more
real

83
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:06,550
everything else is going to be fake but
what one element

84
00:06:06,055 --> 00:06:11,061
are we trying to explore and get
feedback on the second question

85
00:06:11,061 --> 00:06:14,155
is what can we fake and that everything
out everything else will pretty much

86
00:06:15,055 --> 00:06:16,354
just be a picture

87
00:06:16,849 --> 00:06:20,000
the third important question

88
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,038
is where we'll be in use it we want to
make sure

89
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:26,119
that if we're making a prototype it
something that we can try out

90
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:30,107
on the device in the play where people
will be using

91
00:06:31,007 --> 00:06:35,156
so we've made a fake ap

92
00:06:35,219 --> 00:06:38,276
now it's time to show it to people we
wanna after BAM

93
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:42,797
three questions as we're showing them do
you know how to do

94
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:47,653
this one particular thing that we have
protect is it

95
00:06:48,229 --> 00:06:52,130
EV to do that thing in general

96
00:06:52,013 --> 00:06:55,022
how can we make a bit better wanna

97
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:58,870
solicit kinda reform import on how we
can improve our app

98
00:06:58,087 --> 00:07:01,126
you be surprised interesting things
people have to say

99
00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:04,941
so who do we show our fake apt to

100
00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:08,320
make sense the people you're after is
for

101
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:12,141
so if your apt given for engineers

102
00:07:12,159 --> 00:07:16,620
going fine for people who are not
engineer don't

103
00:07:16,062 --> 00:07:19,081
argued defend or diff

104
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:23,960
you're not bear to debate the pros and
cons what you prototype

105
00:07:23,096 --> 00:07:29,055
you're there to get information from
people and learn from so we showed some

106
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:29,974
people

107
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:33,475
we probably taken from note three probe
if asked a few questions

108
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:37,570
now we ask ourselves three questions
about what to do next

109
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:40,086
what's working and what we showed them

110
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:45,940
what's not working what do people not
understand when they stumble over with

111
00:07:45,094 --> 00:07:46,176
computer with confusing and someone

112
00:07:47,076 --> 00:07:50,225
and what other ideas to fifty about

113
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:54,972
about what we might want to do next so
again

114
00:07:55,539 --> 00:07:59,620
make showing learn we do this over and
over again until the experience of our

115
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:00,960
product

116
00:08:00,096 --> 00:08:04,097
is great and today we're going to do
that in a few different ways for you

117
00:08:04,097 --> 00:08:06,796
guys we're gonna protect with pictures

118
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:11,746
just drawing for the device they were
protected animation

119
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:15,439
so we can see how different screens will
be drawn work together

120
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:18,740
and then we're gonna prototype with
interaction

121
00:08:18,074 --> 00:08:23,403
we can see how the entire experience
field in our hand on the device

122
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:27,116
now to protect the pictures were
actually gonna do in Kenya today

123
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:30,680
Tina fact easy and cheap and love you
probably already have it on your

124
00:08:30,068 --> 00:08:31,081
computer

125
00:08:31,081 --> 00:08:34,350
but in practice you can use anything
that can shop up pictures

126
00:08:35,079 --> 00:08:38,087
and rocky basic shapes

127
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,640
for animation we're actually also gonna
prototype with keno

128
00:08:41,064 --> 00:08:45,066
which is a surprisingly sophisticated
animation tool but you can use anything

129
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:48,151
that can move pictures around on the
screen over time

130
00:08:49,051 --> 00:08:53,093
and a prototype for interaction were
actually gonna use objective-c Inc or

131
00:08:53,093 --> 00:08:54,112
animation

132
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:58,140
that's what we knew three can lead to
prototype concept

133
00:08:58,014 --> 00:09:02,063
and if actually easier than you think if
you're not a developer

134
00:09:02,063 --> 00:09:05,147
if you are developer you're gonna see if
you that in a slightly different way

135
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:09,079
then you might be cell

136
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:12,176
I'd like to recap for you the key
features a postmodern

137
00:09:13,076 --> 00:09:16,139
are beautiful world-changing disruptive

138
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:22,104
application we want to find 250 feet
near me

139
00:09:23,004 --> 00:09:26,010
wanna find the top toasty post ofc

140
00:09:26,064 --> 00:09:31,873
rate toast reviewing discussed host with
my fellow test aficionado

141
00:09:32,449 --> 00:09:37,430
your light oak features so record is
gonna pared down to talking about

142
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:40,101
the first two fighting talk to a sticky
and

143
00:09:41,001 --> 00:09:44,570
finding toasty near me to begin the
prototyping process

144
00:09:44,579 --> 00:09:51,579
I'd like to ask me the donkey come to
the stage

145
00:09:53,021 --> 00:09:56,119
thanks Jeff good morning fell

146
00:09:57,019 --> 00:10:02,042
so to figure out how finding togther app
is gonna work

147
00:10:02,042 --> 00:10:08,120
where to begin by making pictures for
here we third of by drawing just attack

148
00:10:09,002 --> 00:10:10,051
high enough different batches

149
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:13,095
to quickly get down only ideas in her
head

150
00:10:13,095 --> 00:10:16,131
for ways we can show nearby as well as
top rated tho

151
00:10:17,031 --> 00:10:20,036
now on party we always start

152
00:10:20,081 --> 00:10:24,155
from hand-drawn concept I'm gonna really
emphasize that you guys all do it to you

153
00:10:25,055 --> 00:10:29,072
if you're not already doing that this
just no faster

154
00:10:29,072 --> 00:10:32,133
or cheaper way to get ideas flowing to
explore

155
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:38,034
hope fluid direction and they're drawing
and Ryan find

156
00:10:38,034 --> 00:10:42,126
like who doesn't want to dream up a 10%
increase the disposable ideas now you

157
00:10:43,026 --> 00:10:43,120
guys rape

158
00:10:44,002 --> 00:10:48,045
and keep in mind you don't have to be an
artist to do this

159
00:10:48,063 --> 00:10:51,067
maybe your drawings look more like live

160
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:57,075
whatever I mean don't go showing that
flight board meetings or anything but

161
00:10:57,075 --> 00:11:02,147
the point remain that we're trying to
emphasize but you should

162
00:11:03,047 --> 00:11:06,065
not star prototyping from just a single
idea

163
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:09,074
you want to explore and understand the
whole space

164
00:11:10,055 --> 00:11:13,057
in order to figure out the best
direction for your app

165
00:11:13,057 --> 00:11:16,124
so when we were comparing all

166
00:11:17,024 --> 00:11:20,108
re-do therefore that stood out as really
compelling

167
00:11:21,008 --> 00:11:24,094
this let's grid map

168
00:11:24,094 --> 00:11:28,168
and gallery so why did we choose the
former well

169
00:11:29,068 --> 00:11:32,121
not only do they convey are typeof
information really well

170
00:11:33,021 --> 00:11:37,078
and they also unlike some of the other
ideas

171
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:40,094
part overly complex or to elaborate

172
00:11:40,094 --> 00:11:43,139
we want to start simple also

173
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:48,117
they represent four distinct directions
that are app can take

174
00:11:49,017 --> 00:11:52,065
as opposed to being variations a single
idea

175
00:11:52,065 --> 00:11:55,139
and great every move of them that we
found

176
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:59,121
all this out super quick on paper before
devoting a lot of time

177
00:12:00,021 --> 00:12:04,058
exploring just one concept and so

178
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:07,125
I've got my sketches and it's no big
deal now

179
00:12:08,025 --> 00:12:11,027
they're just sketches so I can just
throw away all the other ideas that

180
00:12:11,045 --> 00:12:11,141
didn't work out

181
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:15,128
to just focus on making these for more
real

182
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:19,107
and to do that we're gonna turn them
into from faye caps

183
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:24,048
so the first question we're going to ask
ourselves is

184
00:12:24,048 --> 00:12:27,110
what needs to be more real why are we
making these fake abs

185
00:12:28,001 --> 00:12:31,042
what's our goal so right now we just
have drawing

186
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:35,110
sobibor even think about touching any
code we're gonna determine

187
00:12:36,001 --> 00:12:40,010
how these ideas will look on the screen
in our hands

188
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:44,026
second question we're gonna after South
what can we fake

189
00:12:44,026 --> 00:12:48,071
watch or cat can we take well we can
take pretty much

190
00:12:48,071 --> 00:12:51,166
all the content we don't need a database
so

191
00:12:52,066 --> 00:12:56,089
tell was photographed a location we can
make up filler tax and we're gonna use

192
00:12:56,089 --> 00:12:57,105
temporary icon

193
00:12:58,005 --> 00:13:01,073
and Napoli where were you

194
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:04,097
well we're gonna put the screen on
actual iPhone

195
00:13:04,097 --> 00:13:08,099
and use them outside said

196
00:13:09,017 --> 00:13:13,105
we're gonna start off with this catch a
a toast with you sorted by rating

197
00:13:14,005 --> 00:13:18,033
now before we dive straight into
translating this to the screen

198
00:13:18,033 --> 00:13:22,072
we'll see if we can save yourself some
time by borrowing elements from in this

199
00:13:22,072 --> 00:13:23,083
thing I what's up

200
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:26,152
and just term browsing on my phone

201
00:13:27,052 --> 00:13:31,111
I've noticed that the music app actually
have a relief similar structure

202
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:35,059
to our sketch so what used this I have

203
00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:39,081
our way to kinda layout rido and

204
00:13:39,081 --> 00:13:42,097
the way we can do that as we're just
gonna take a snapshot

205
00:13:42,097 --> 00:13:46,109
on the screen for my phone and imported

206
00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:51,046
into keynote for Mac now we on our team

207
00:13:51,046 --> 00:13:54,117
use keynote really frequently to make
super quick prototypes because I have a

208
00:13:55,017 --> 00:13:56,090
tiny really useful tools

209
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:59,058
that make aligning photograph and images
relieving

210
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:03,086
but you guys should be using whatever
image editing

211
00:14:03,086 --> 00:14:07,130
tool you're most comfortable in so if
you've done this type of stuff before

212
00:14:08,003 --> 00:14:11,292
maybe you're in Photoshop or pick for
made our sketch

213
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:15,040
if you're a developer who's never done
image editing

214
00:14:15,004 --> 00:14:18,073
for a great place to start of is preview
for Mac

215
00:14:18,073 --> 00:14:22,302
so we got our screenshot what do we do
next

216
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,100
we want to block of the main areas %uh

217
00:14:26,001 --> 00:14:29,030
the UI in order to create ourselves the
table template

218
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:32,044
to drop in our own content into

219
00:14:32,044 --> 00:14:35,087
so the way we're going to do that and he
know is actually open up

220
00:14:35,087 --> 00:14:38,136
the shape menu and Robin just a ton of
boxes

221
00:14:39,036 --> 00:14:42,054
to block of the navigation bar

222
00:14:42,054 --> 00:14:46,100
all photograph the borders

223
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,049
in the background so great now we have a
basic structure to work of both

224
00:14:52,049 --> 00:14:55,094
next up if they get that navigation bar

225
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:58,105
to be the right color so to do that
Aquino

226
00:14:59,005 --> 00:15:03,051
you open up the color picker and using
that magnifying glass tool

227
00:15:03,051 --> 00:15:06,054
sample the color the status bar about it
and

228
00:15:06,081 --> 00:15:10,082
now we've got ourselves a blank
navigation bar now that was a really

229
00:15:10,091 --> 00:15:10,182
simple right

230
00:15:11,082 --> 00:15:15,085
well that's because we're using a
screenshot if you don't need to know

231
00:15:16,012 --> 00:15:20,101
exact pixel dimensions or even colors
you I lament

232
00:15:20,209 --> 00:15:25,230
in order to recreate them which they've
us a ton of time

233
00:15:25,023 --> 00:15:28,038
and so the next thing I want to do is a
add in some content

234
00:15:28,038 --> 00:15:31,136
and in particular some images so

235
00:15:32,036 --> 00:15:35,037
here is that some photographs I took
this morning on my

236
00:15:35,037 --> 00:15:38,095
delete host excursion and gonna have

237
00:15:38,095 --> 00:15:42,127
put in this good-looking one and now
what i'm looking at that photograph

238
00:15:43,027 --> 00:15:46,124
I'm thinking maybe instead of just a
plane square thumbnail

239
00:15:47,024 --> 00:15:51,107
we could do something cool where we crop
the image to a circle and fill you can

240
00:15:52,007 --> 00:15:54,073
see the plate and the toast

241
00:15:54,073 --> 00:15:58,079
and for luckily for us can you actually
have a great Federer options to be able

242
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,498
to mask and image

243
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:04,780
to any shape so we're gonna choose the
overall math care

244
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:07,173
aum's now we've got a perfectly cropped
played host

245
00:16:08,073 --> 00:16:11,080
that we can yeah thank you guys

246
00:16:11,008 --> 00:16:14,047
that we can cut into our playful there
and

247
00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:19,022
we're just gonna repeat that same
process for other images

248
00:16:19,022 --> 00:16:22,081
now know if where does using the fame
three images

249
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:25,860
over and over again and that's because
we don't want to spend more time the

250
00:16:26,589 --> 00:16:28,830
necessary creating content

251
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:32,140
3 picture the terrace for all your
strength totally fine

252
00:16:33,004 --> 00:16:36,078
and so one please images are in place
now we can get rid of those playful

253
00:16:37,014 --> 00:16:37,022
there's

254
00:16:37,094 --> 00:16:41,099
and right off the bat I'm sure you note
is a mess you can see the play protest

255
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:43,050
on a background

256
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:48,086
so how do we fix that 3 at Borders three
and drop shadows do we change the

257
00:16:48,086 --> 00:16:49,144
background image

258
00:16:50,044 --> 00:16:53,051
what like what are the parameters are
you well

259
00:16:53,051 --> 00:16:57,051
whole lot those are all visual design
decisions but we can make

260
00:16:57,051 --> 00:17:00,092
further down the line if we even decide
to go with that stir

261
00:17:00,092 --> 00:17:04,098
this direction for now we're gonna do
something super basic

262
00:17:05,052 --> 00:17:08,063
and just add in a simple one people
border

263
00:17:08,063 --> 00:17:11,142
around all over image oath and on

264
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:17,370
where already more than doubled we don't
worry about the details on that later

265
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:20,122
and so now we've got my images a toast I
wanna way below

266
00:17:21,022 --> 00:17:23,111
and fed to help with or without we're
actually gonna take that way box where

267
00:17:24,011 --> 00:17:25,064
you have a background

268
00:17:25,064 --> 00:17:29,073
and make a transparent so this way the
music app is now picking through

269
00:17:29,073 --> 00:17:32,081
and we can see how the way both and that
screen

270
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:36,053
are laid out in order to help us

271
00:17:36,053 --> 00:17:39,074
way out m5 are intact

272
00:17:39,074 --> 00:17:42,119
and I noticed the location doing the

273
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:46,044
you can get her with with go butter and
trout on it

274
00:17:46,044 --> 00:17:50,533
that nothing we're just faking tax
because it quick

275
00:17:50,929 --> 00:17:56,540
and we don't have to worry about it for
global production really coming together

276
00:17:56,054 --> 00:18:00,072
we just can appear pathway in the back
on again

277
00:18:00,072 --> 00:18:04,075
and make them little tweaks and
adjustments about the layout worked for

278
00:18:04,075 --> 00:18:06,081
or composition

279
00:18:07,035 --> 00:18:11,037
so the only thing that's missing right
now is ratings

280
00:18:11,037 --> 00:18:15,037
and so for this I'm actually gonna go
into the special characters menu

281
00:18:15,037 --> 00:18:19,044
with someone you guys may or may not be
already familiar with

282
00:18:20,007 --> 00:18:24,040
for here we actually get a giant with a
pre-existing them both

283
00:18:24,004 --> 00:18:27,763
and characters that we can repurpose
icon

284
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:32,159
for our layout so I found my father
really knife

285
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:35,390
star some old but I wanted used to
represent

286
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,114
ratings I was gonna drop it on other
then

287
00:18:39,014 --> 00:18:43,049
align them together and we've got some
reading of them

288
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:46,468
now I think it puts pre doke but

289
00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:50,620
I think the stars could really use a tan
color cuz I wanna make them look

290
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:55,075
active later so what particular color
used now

291
00:18:55,075 --> 00:18:58,159
doesn't matter so we're just gonna go
into keynote

292
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:03,087
default color palette and choose the
color that make that

293
00:19:03,087 --> 00:19:06,183
so here it is orange because the Peter
whose TF color

294
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:11,084
the rambo great now I've got some porn
stars

295
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:15,127
and then look more active already and I
really like that color so much you gonna

296
00:19:16,027 --> 00:19:19,074
change the border the image to be the
same color

297
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:22,081
and now we've got a nice relationship
going between the picture the terrace

298
00:19:23,044 --> 00:19:26,072
and its rating their color

299
00:19:26,072 --> 00:19:30,511
and so last but not least I'm gonna add
a control to the top right hand side

300
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:35,550
the ap so that someone can add in a new
photograph

301
00:19:35,055 --> 00:19:38,096
a putative and

302
00:19:38,096 --> 00:19:43,123
here we can get all fancy with custom
shapes and masking and

303
00:19:44,023 --> 00:19:47,039
doing all sorts of intricate stuff but
remember

304
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,063
we only care about temporary icons right
now

305
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:55,100
so instead we are literally going to you
at an attack sparked

306
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,001
tape in the plot them all and

307
00:19:59,001 --> 00:20:04,063
now you have designed an icon in five
seconds graduation

308
00:20:04,072 --> 00:20:07,095
alright yeah fattened

309
00:20:07,095 --> 00:20:11,140
and must not leave just scribble on a
title for your screen

310
00:20:12,004 --> 00:20:15,025
and there you go one freshly baked green

311
00:20:15,061 --> 00:20:18,108
ready to be tapped

312
00:20:19,008 --> 00:20:22,026
now one thing to really keep in mind

313
00:20:22,026 --> 00:20:25,121
when you're making three in on any
program it's remembered in the room

314
00:20:26,021 --> 00:20:31,097
out to the physical 5 the device that
you're 30 going to live on

315
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:35,135
it's really easy to get caught up
working at a zoom level

316
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:40,062
were everything is big and clear and
legible

317
00:20:40,062 --> 00:20:44,097
to remember every time you added a new
element onto the screen

318
00:20:44,097 --> 00:20:47,112
to view Mount and check if that peace
attacks

319
00:20:48,012 --> 00:20:51,021
or that picture is by the readable
legible

320
00:20:51,021 --> 00:20:56,470
and have a ball catch that early on

321
00:20:56,659 --> 00:21:02,730
so now I thought 13 muddy and that
Sprint I guess about 10 minutes to make

322
00:21:02,073 --> 00:21:06,002
if we were to have worried too much
about

323
00:21:06,659 --> 00:21:10,030
all the visual nuances about the screen
that have

324
00:21:10,003 --> 00:21:12,062
we would be here for the next hour and
it should be a really boring

325
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,071
presentation

326
00:21:14,071 --> 00:21:17,076
instead we take shortcuts and that's
fine

327
00:21:18,021 --> 00:21:22,230
because these aren't going to be our
final three

328
00:21:22,419 --> 00:21:26,120
and so in a rinse and repeat that
process up screen shotting

329
00:21:26,012 --> 00:21:31,075
masking arranging object and adding
basic content to the rest the right idea

330
00:21:31,075 --> 00:21:34,147
like orbit you idea which much like the
camera roll

331
00:21:35,047 --> 00:21:38,088
and and practices like kinda

332
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:42,144
too much to ask for a lot of the lookout

333
00:21:43,044 --> 00:21:48,023
or our map idea which I know that looks
pretty interesting I think that would be

334
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:51,610
really fun to play with

335
00:21:51,061 --> 00:21:54,064
or our gallery weather app idea

336
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:57,115
which just like looks really cool

337
00:21:58,015 --> 00:22:03,107
and so now I've got my four screens and
again they're not gonna be our final 25

338
00:22:04,007 --> 00:22:07,031
there's many places where we can refine
the

339
00:22:07,031 --> 00:22:11,055
visual a parents and/or

340
00:22:11,055 --> 00:22:15,089
a the styling overall on the screen

341
00:22:15,089 --> 00:22:18,172
but we're not gonna do that because it's
okay because we didn't make

342
00:22:19,072 --> 00:22:22,075
these applications to become forge
appear shop

343
00:22:22,075 --> 00:22:27,096
we made them so that we could test out
how successful each concept will be

344
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:30,155
that way when we do you devote our time
and efforts

345
00:22:31,055 --> 00:22:34,120
polishing the visuals over final screen
10

346
00:22:35,002 --> 00:22:38,093
we're doing it to the right idea

347
00:22:39,011 --> 00:22:42,073
and so what's next well we have a screen
we're gonna

348
00:22:42,073 --> 00:22:46,772
drop them onto an iPhone and give them
to people to test out

349
00:22:47,429 --> 00:22:50,500
for the way we're gonna do that is when
I go back and pick you know

350
00:22:50,005 --> 00:22:55,033
exporter presentation into images and
specifically PNG

351
00:22:55,078 --> 00:22:59,085
and then use whatever method you want to
get those images onto your phone

352
00:22:59,085 --> 00:23:02,146
so that might be photostream the new I
Cloud Drive

353
00:23:03,046 --> 00:23:07,133
or you can just email them to yourself

354
00:23:08,033 --> 00:23:11,090
and then once you've got them on your
phone given to your friend

355
00:23:11,009 --> 00:23:14,098
given to your coworkers given to a
variety of people

356
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:19,153
and just observe them like booking app
experience right now

357
00:23:20,053 --> 00:23:23,130
see if they can even figure out what
this app does

358
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:27,027
theater read differently indoors as
opposed to outdoors

359
00:23:27,054 --> 00:23:33,054
it probably will and then once you've
just observe them for a little bit

360
00:23:33,054 --> 00:23:36,112
you want to ask them three questions

361
00:23:37,012 --> 00:23:40,036
do you know how to find top-rated toast

362
00:23:40,036 --> 00:23:44,047
what about nearby toast and the feedback
that we got was

363
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:47,048
yeah raining the star I can't make it
really

364
00:23:47,057 --> 00:23:51,062
obvious how to find top-rated terrorist
but

365
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:54,128
there might has is really hard to figure
out if it not laid out on a map

366
00:23:55,028 --> 00:23:58,053
so that's a really useful information
for you to have in order to make

367
00:23:58,053 --> 00:24:01,058
iterations on your screen

368
00:24:01,058 --> 00:24:05,637
second anyone ask if it easy to browse
through tears

369
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,950
and it seems that yeah people are having
a pretty

370
00:24:09,095 --> 00:24:12,114
easy time reading through all the three
innings except for

371
00:24:13,014 --> 00:24:18,055
course that great view that no one likes
because it hurt in the retina

372
00:24:18,055 --> 00:24:22,096
and then lastly how can we make this
better how can we improve

373
00:24:22,096 --> 00:24:26,148
ans maybe we just got the confirm for
fat you know you guys should really go

374
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:30,081
through the list and the map you that
things are really resonate with people

375
00:24:30,081 --> 00:24:34,149
we should probably refine the
interactions and those two screens more

376
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:38,124
and so to tell you how to do that with
animation I'm actually going to invite

377
00:24:39,024 --> 00:24:45,087
Julia mythic onto the stage

378
00:24:45,087 --> 00:24:49,184
thank you enough now we're getting the
feedback I'm going to take you through

379
00:24:50,084 --> 00:24:54,098
another spin around the Spurs I think
cycle

380
00:24:54,098 --> 00:24:57,098
we should take a step back and learn
from

381
00:24:57,098 --> 00:25:01,145
from the feedback we got with working so
far

382
00:25:02,045 --> 00:25:05,059
well we have a variety of methods

383
00:25:05,059 --> 00:25:08,154
organizing with information we have

384
00:25:09,054 --> 00:25:13,058
live and galleries grid map

385
00:25:13,058 --> 00:25:17,064
we don't yet have one best way

386
00:25:17,064 --> 00:25:21,075
to find and discover Toth we have a
couple

387
00:25:21,075 --> 00:25:26,075
sometimes people theme to prefer to look
for toast Buy rating

388
00:25:26,075 --> 00:25:29,087
and sometimes I just wanna find the
closest

389
00:25:29,087 --> 00:25:33,176
the perhaps our app could let people
choose

390
00:25:34,076 --> 00:25:37,225
sometimes people could search for toast
Buy rating

391
00:25:37,909 --> 00:25:42,370
and sometimes they can look for it on a
map

392
00:25:42,037 --> 00:25:48,566
would like to make a prototype to try to
understand how this could work

393
00:25:48,899 --> 00:25:53,130
the thing that we want to make more real
in this prototype

394
00:25:53,013 --> 00:25:58,014
is the connection between screens that
have topped oath

395
00:25:58,023 --> 00:26:02,048
and a screen has a map on it because the
rapid can have both these things in it

396
00:26:02,048 --> 00:26:04,097
at some point in time

397
00:26:04,097 --> 00:26:08,786
we don't yet need to make fully
interactive screens will need to be able

398
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:09,735
to tap

399
00:26:10,419 --> 00:26:13,770
on each piece of toast we going to
scroll through these lists we actually

400
00:26:13,077 --> 00:26:14,096
don't even need to have

401
00:26:14,096 --> 00:26:17,133
final designs for the screen because

402
00:26:18,033 --> 00:26:21,052
if we're doing things correctly were
probably actually going to go

403
00:26:21,052 --> 00:26:27,084
back and redraw them to the screens
based upon what we've learned

404
00:26:27,084 --> 00:26:30,157
as we make a more realistic prototype we
should also

405
00:26:31,057 --> 00:26:34,886
maker contact a little bit more real so
in this case

406
00:26:35,399 --> 00:26:38,476
this is not the party the app forward in
a restaurant taking pictures

407
00:26:39,169 --> 00:26:43,260
we're still trying to find the
restaurant we will be at

408
00:26:43,026 --> 00:26:46,415
so I'm probably walking around

409
00:26:46,649 --> 00:26:49,810
on a busy sidewalk starting to get
really hungry

410
00:26:49,081 --> 00:26:52,135
looking for a piece of toast the I'm
gonna be kinda distracted not paying a

411
00:26:53,035 --> 00:26:55,114
lot of attention to my phone

412
00:26:55,429 --> 00:26:59,100
this means that I'm not going to spend a
lot of time trying to

413
00:26:59,001 --> 00:27:02,330
figure out how this app works and
navigate through it I'm just looking for

414
00:27:02,429 --> 00:27:03,502
this restaurant

415
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,210
other was mentioning before the thing
that we want to make more realistic in

416
00:27:07,021 --> 00:27:08,034
its prototype

417
00:27:08,034 --> 00:27:13,041
is the connection or relationship
between two different screen

418
00:27:14,004 --> 00:27:17,097
at one point in time this app is going
to have a screen

419
00:27:17,097 --> 00:27:21,103
they will have top two the rating at
another point I'm

420
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:26,057
this Apple have a screen the live nearby
text for a map

421
00:27:26,057 --> 00:27:29,071
foods app is going to be changing
overtime

422
00:27:29,071 --> 00:27:32,104
between these two screen and a change
over time

423
00:27:33,004 --> 00:27:37,027
is an animation rate now

424
00:27:37,027 --> 00:27:42,032
there are a variety of tools that you
can use to make animation

425
00:27:42,032 --> 00:27:45,037
if you're a designer you might be
familiar with tools such as motion

426
00:27:45,082 --> 00:27:48,084
after-effects records composer

427
00:27:49,002 --> 00:27:52,361
if you're a developer you might use
tools such as

428
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:57,720
HTML CSS animations for processing

429
00:27:57,072 --> 00:28:00,149
either way we think you might be able to
use tools such as hype

430
00:28:01,049 --> 00:28:06,077
I had producer for Tina

431
00:28:06,077 --> 00:28:10,100
as jeff mentioned earlier we're going to
be buildings animation think you know

432
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,008
we can actually run keynote on her
iPhone

433
00:28:14,008 --> 00:28:18,059
and see the animation life there we can
make modifications rapidly

434
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:21,071
back on our Mac and see the changes
reflected our iPhone

435
00:28:21,071 --> 00:28:26,154
really quick and if the tool that we use
a lot in our team

436
00:28:27,054 --> 00:28:30,145
so we're just gonna open keno and we
will grab

437
00:28:31,045 --> 00:28:34,059
the two slides that we made earlier

438
00:28:34,059 --> 00:28:38,133
and drop in and have the only two slides
in our presentation

439
00:28:39,033 --> 00:28:43,582
we will go over to the enemy palette and
you the transition

440
00:28:43,879 --> 00:28:49,030
here we'll just use move in from bottoms
up

441
00:28:49,003 --> 00:28:54,064
let's just think about looks like

442
00:28:54,064 --> 00:28:57,090
so this flight in from bottom to top is
perhaps

443
00:28:57,009 --> 00:29:00,067
like some other sheet animation that I
left has where

444
00:29:01,048 --> 00:29:04,061
from temporary information laid on top
I'll other information

445
00:29:04,061 --> 00:29:11,061
maybe with move out for example E well
this was a lot like that navigate back

446
00:29:11,064 --> 00:29:13,119
animation you're going back up the
navigation hierarchy

447
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:17,088
maybe we could flip it over

448
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:20,106
maybe this is

449
00:29:21,006 --> 00:29:24,011
some kinda setting or information behind
another screen

450
00:29:24,056 --> 00:29:27,094
the thing that I'm trying to get across
here

451
00:29:27,094 --> 00:29:31,156
is that any animation you choose is
communicating something about the

452
00:29:32,056 --> 00:29:32,141
relationship

453
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:37,098
the screen have with one another even if
it's no animation at all

454
00:29:37,098 --> 00:29:40,179
it's just the pop that something that

455
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:44,084
shows almost no relationship between the
screen they're just being replaced by

456
00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:45,086
one another

457
00:29:45,086 --> 00:29:49,109
but in this case that's not really
what's going on here

458
00:29:50,009 --> 00:29:54,068
but we have is two different views the
same information

459
00:29:54,068 --> 00:29:57,068
perhaps those three restaurants that are
in the map

460
00:29:57,068 --> 00:30:01,106
are three restaurants from that list for
something we want to communicate as we

461
00:30:02,006 --> 00:30:03,079
transition between the screen

462
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:07,079
now before we get a little bit further

463
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:10,090
within keno I just like to explain
something about

464
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:17,009
two different types have animation we
think you know the first is called a

465
00:30:17,092 --> 00:30:18,093
build animation

466
00:30:19,002 --> 00:30:22,060
either animations that happen objectors
shapes

467
00:30:22,006 --> 00:30:25,059
within a slide you can

468
00:30:26,013 --> 00:30:29,076
build into shape perform actions on it
build-out

469
00:30:29,076 --> 00:30:33,080
you can use the builder power to set up
a pretty sophisticated

470
00:30:34,016 --> 00:30:37,030
sequin a build animations all with an
applied

471
00:30:37,003 --> 00:30:41,011
but there's another type of animation

472
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:46,065
called a transition and the transition
is an animation that happens between to

473
00:30:46,065 --> 00:30:46,123
slide

474
00:30:47,023 --> 00:30:51,075
those are the animations we're just
playing with now there's a particular

475
00:30:51,075 --> 00:30:52,138
kind of transition

476
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:56,119
called Magic new that's really
interesting for our purposes

477
00:30:57,019 --> 00:31:01,117
would magic move does is it tries to
identify

478
00:31:02,017 --> 00:31:06,018
objects are shapes that are the same on
the to slide

479
00:31:06,027 --> 00:31:10,038
and it will create an interpolation

480
00:31:10,038 --> 00:31:14,127
love the position sizing opacity and
other properties are shape

481
00:31:15,027 --> 00:31:20,028
so for example if magic move identifies

482
00:31:20,037 --> 00:31:25,038
the three circles as the same on these
two slides in might produce an animation

483
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:30,089
like this now if you're familiar with
animation tools

484
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:34,151
you may recognize we're starting to use
the slide as if they're keep rain

485
00:31:35,051 --> 00:31:39,124
in a larger animation that makes it a
lot easier to

486
00:31:40,024 --> 00:31:46,108
sequence out and separate the different
that the animation for you to go back to

487
00:31:47,008 --> 00:31:47,054
Kenya

488
00:31:47,054 --> 00:31:50,133
and choose the enemy

489
00:31:51,033 --> 00:31:54,130
palette now that you know that he knows

490
00:31:55,003 --> 00:31:59,072
two types of animation or does note here
real quick if you have a shape selected

491
00:31:59,099 --> 00:32:04,125
the enemy palette will show you build
animation if you have no shapes like

492
00:32:05,025 --> 00:32:06,076
that it's just the slide

493
00:32:06,076 --> 00:32:09,140
that's when you'll get these transition
animations that we're using today

494
00:32:10,004 --> 00:32:15,007
we're gonna change the transition to
magic move and without changing

495
00:32:15,043 --> 00:32:18,106
anything at all about those two slides
that we've dropped in

496
00:32:19,006 --> 00:32:26,006
but the magic new gether you can see
there's already a lot more interesting

497
00:32:27,062 --> 00:32:30,150
than the transitions we're playing with
earlier because we don't be floods in

498
00:32:31,005 --> 00:32:31,066
keno

499
00:32:32,011 --> 00:32:35,103
and use the same images

500
00:32:36,003 --> 00:32:39,071
on both the left and the map the magic
new transition

501
00:32:39,071 --> 00:32:42,129
moved those images over and we can start
to see that maybe those restaurants in

502
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:46,035
the famous to screen maybe that's an
interesting way to do this transition

503
00:32:46,035 --> 00:32:49,086
but there are a couple things we can
make better

504
00:32:49,086 --> 00:32:53,093
%uh the first thing that I noticed was
there within our prototype

505
00:32:53,093 --> 00:32:57,128
we don't really even have a take way to
get between these two screens

506
00:32:58,028 --> 00:33:01,124
for to make it a little bit more
realistic for the weekend kinda imagine

507
00:33:02,024 --> 00:33:05,123
how you would navigate between the
screen will just drop in a tabbar

508
00:33:06,023 --> 00:33:10,072
for now and this tab or similar to the
thing when it was showing you earlier

509
00:33:10,072 --> 00:33:13,089
is just a rectangle from the

510
00:33:13,089 --> 00:33:19,136
shape tool encina the star could be from
the special characters and star-shaped

511
00:33:20,036 --> 00:33:24,053
and that little map icon that's just
using the line tool to

512
00:33:24,053 --> 00:33:28,100
draw quick littles a quick little
playful there

513
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,086
these don't need to be perfect just yet
because we don't even notice and the

514
00:33:31,086 --> 00:33:35,122
direction we're going to take

515
00:33:36,022 --> 00:33:39,118
I also noticed how the list

516
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:43,072
they did out we had white for a while

517
00:33:43,072 --> 00:33:47,080
and in the map stated in this is because
what magic move doing

518
00:33:48,052 --> 00:33:51,104
is feeding out shapes that won't exist

519
00:33:52,004 --> 00:33:57,023
first for the first after the animation
and then after that midpoint

520
00:33:57,023 --> 00:34:01,056
the second half for the animation is
speeding in new shape

521
00:34:01,056 --> 00:34:04,120
so we can get around that by making sure
that are shaped exist

522
00:34:05,002 --> 00:34:08,481
on both flied some going to copy

523
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:13,090
that map image that I I want to feed in
throughout the entire duration of the

524
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,098
animation

525
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:17,850
gonna copy that from the second flight
piece that

526
00:34:17,085 --> 00:34:22,128
on that first slide move it all the way
behind all the other shapes

527
00:34:23,028 --> 00:34:26,049
and then just for fun make it a little
bit larger

528
00:34:26,049 --> 00:34:30,688
than it is on the second flight fluid
with the magic movie animation will give

529
00:34:31,129 --> 00:34:31,750
us

530
00:34:31,075 --> 00:34:34,111
will be maybe a little bit other
perspective shifted the

531
00:34:35,011 --> 00:34:38,044
map is shrinking at speeding in

532
00:34:38,044 --> 00:34:42,533
a few that look like

533
00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:46,934
pretty

534
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:50,470
but there are couple other things we can
do to make this even better

535
00:34:50,047 --> 00:34:54,466
because right now we're not writing any
code so we can try out some

536
00:34:54,889 --> 00:34:57,953
maybe over-the-top animation and

537
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:03,460
take them out later pared down to to
just what it means but for now it's so

538
00:35:03,046 --> 00:35:04,049
little work to

539
00:35:04,076 --> 00:35:07,385
explore a lot of interesting
alternatives that

540
00:35:08,069 --> 00:35:14,069
we should just try everything we think
we might try in this example here

541
00:35:14,069 --> 00:35:17,140
I am looking at the title

542
00:35:17,779 --> 00:35:21,630
others to slide the title was another
one where

543
00:35:21,063 --> 00:35:26,092
we faded out that top tooth title and
then faded in nearby texting defeated

544
00:35:26,092 --> 00:35:26,791
three great

545
00:35:27,619 --> 00:35:30,685
but I don't really like like how that
worked

546
00:35:31,279 --> 00:35:35,890
so I'm gonna copy the top two sleep well
from the first slide pissed on a second

547
00:35:35,089 --> 00:35:35,144
flight

548
00:35:36,044 --> 00:35:40,119
do vice versa so that both those label
this number of life I'm gonna shift

549
00:35:41,019 --> 00:35:44,068
the one that should be fading out
horizontally

550
00:35:44,068 --> 00:35:47,075
off to one side drop at the past 30 down
20

551
00:35:48,038 --> 00:35:51,041
you're having a little bit higher def
you can see it but

552
00:35:51,041 --> 00:35:54,090
the fact that it will give is the title
will be

553
00:35:54,009 --> 00:35:57,458
stating in and sliding horizontally at
the same time

554
00:35:58,349 --> 00:36:03,350
as the other one is spitting out else
wanted to do something

555
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:09,690
about those restaurant names on the list
unlikely to speed it out in place

556
00:36:09,069 --> 00:36:13,070
so I copied his restaurant names from
the first slide

557
00:36:13,007 --> 00:36:16,032
that list pay for them on the second
flight

558
00:36:16,095 --> 00:36:19,170
the map and I ship them the way of the
side of the screen

559
00:36:20,007 --> 00:36:24,009
will drop their path to be a little bit
so we're gonna slide out

560
00:36:24,009 --> 00:36:29,018
now a little bit approach appear if you
stagger them horizontally a little bit

561
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:33,125
the animation speeds will be a little
bit different

562
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:38,050
for each item so they will feel like the
think items

563
00:36:38,005 --> 00:36:41,102
not like part of one she sliding away
because the third think items in a list

564
00:36:42,047 --> 00:36:43,066
and would like to reinforce that

565
00:36:43,066 --> 00:36:47,102
finally

566
00:36:48,002 --> 00:36:52,074
15 built up both the Flies to the point
where I'm pretty happy with them

567
00:36:52,074 --> 00:36:55,152
I will have an animation from a lift to
the map

568
00:36:56,052 --> 00:36:59,126
but to get an animation from the map
back to the list

569
00:37:00,026 --> 00:37:03,295
all I have to do is duplicate

570
00:37:03,529 --> 00:37:06,760
that first flight that list and place it
at the end

571
00:37:06,076 --> 00:37:09,124
as a third slide and now without doing
any extra work

572
00:37:10,024 --> 00:37:13,072
I have an animation back in the other
direction it's important to test they'll

573
00:37:13,072 --> 00:37:13,170
both directions

574
00:37:14,007 --> 00:37:21,007
and it really didn't take much to do
that we'll see what we have

575
00:37:22,041 --> 00:37:28,096
after rebuildable animation in the back

576
00:37:28,096 --> 00:37:32,975
now so too little flower thing and he's
in the details maybe this isn't

577
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:40,839
as well as we would have it in the
relapse we did all this without having

578
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:41,138
to write

579
00:37:41,849 --> 00:37:46,710
any code you can see how maybe some love
it is a little over the top

580
00:37:46,071 --> 00:37:53,071
thank you to maybe something to the
little over the top but

581
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:57,140
its so much easier to pare down and take
away things when you don't have to throw

582
00:37:58,004 --> 00:37:58,085
a code

583
00:37:59,021 --> 00:38:03,090
it is moving shapes around that the
really great way to try out from really

584
00:38:03,009 --> 00:38:04,038
sophisticated animation

585
00:38:05,019 --> 00:38:08,878
we also really liked this

586
00:38:09,049 --> 00:38:12,750
the very graphical gallery view that
Linda called out of

587
00:38:12,075 --> 00:38:15,434
pretty cool earlier wanted at the howled
work

588
00:38:16,109 --> 00:38:20,220
if we have these angle plate the toes to
me zoom in on one of them just

589
00:38:20,022 --> 00:38:25,096
the Detail View back out

590
00:38:25,096 --> 00:38:32,096
might have to back button and also the
few get a little flower

591
00:38:36,099 --> 00:38:42,948
the thank you so how do we build this
animation

592
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:47,862
well if really was not all that
different from the process I showed you

593
00:38:48,069 --> 00:38:48,740
earlier

594
00:38:48,074 --> 00:38:51,146
that one piece of toast the reason in on

595
00:38:52,046 --> 00:38:55,195
that an angled image

596
00:38:55,609 --> 00:39:00,130
behind all the other shapes the other
pieces of toast

597
00:39:00,013 --> 00:39:03,041
are similar images but there masked out
and on top

598
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:06,074
that navigation bar the slide then

599
00:39:06,074 --> 00:39:09,913
that the black rectangle that we've
shifted off the top of the screen

600
00:39:10,579 --> 00:39:14,460
so we should offer a little ways up
there so it slides in a little bit later

601
00:39:14,046 --> 00:39:14,054
in the animation

602
00:39:15,026 --> 00:39:18,068
and that detail view

603
00:39:18,068 --> 00:39:22,094
the toast that's that same toast image
rotated back straight

604
00:39:22,094 --> 00:39:27,170
a me a bit larger the other piece in the
toaster just

605
00:39:28,007 --> 00:39:31,102
shifted off the top and bottom of the
screen that's really all there is to it

606
00:39:32,065 --> 00:39:36,071
moving from images and shaped around
until you get an animation that

607
00:39:36,071 --> 00:39:43,071
that feels pretty good now that we've
built examination think you know

608
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:47,640
we're gonna launch keynote on our iPod
Touch here

609
00:39:48,369 --> 00:39:51,380
and either through I cloud over email

610
00:39:51,038 --> 00:39:56,247
however you prefer to get them across
actually open that same presentation

611
00:39:56,589 --> 00:40:03,589
in her hand on the device to get a sense
for how it feels we can hand it to

612
00:40:03,619 --> 00:40:04,664
someone and see what they try to do

613
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:10,120
now here you'll notice

614
00:40:10,579 --> 00:40:14,770
that were tapping

615
00:40:14,077 --> 00:40:17,113
on with seem like interactive element
those aren't actually

616
00:40:18,013 --> 00:40:22,090
interactive it just so happens that you
can tap

617
00:40:22,009 --> 00:40:26,018
anywhere on the screen to ban for flight
in keno you can kinda pretend

618
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:29,143
that the interactive elements work
course you tap anywhere else it's still

619
00:40:30,043 --> 00:40:31,069
going to bat for Floyd

620
00:40:31,069 --> 00:40:34,097
we can still get a fan for

621
00:40:34,097 --> 00:40:37,716
where people are trying to interact with
your screen than animation

622
00:40:38,589 --> 00:40:43,940
and what they expect to happen we can do
a similar thing

623
00:40:43,094 --> 00:40:50,094
with the tab bar

624
00:40:56,077 --> 00:40:57,102
and

625
00:40:58,002 --> 00:41:01,010
after we show people and let them

626
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:05,017
express what they think these animations
on the screens are about

627
00:41:05,026 --> 00:41:09,031
we can now in a couple of questions to
try to get specific be back

628
00:41:09,031 --> 00:41:13,063
so we ask if they know how to find
nearby too

629
00:41:13,063 --> 00:41:17,142
well they were able to find toast
although they didn't understand our plea

630
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:18,130
for icon

631
00:41:19,003 --> 00:41:22,069
but that's fine because we knew those
icons were playful earth

632
00:41:22,096 --> 00:41:25,114
and if we decide to go in this direction
we can refine them

633
00:41:26,014 --> 00:41:30,028
we asked if it was EV

634
00:41:30,028 --> 00:41:35,034
to switch between these two screen
certainly they were able to use a tabbar

635
00:41:35,088 --> 00:41:37,119
they've seen those before they could tap
at the bottom and

636
00:41:38,019 --> 00:41:41,107
which screen but

637
00:41:42,007 --> 00:41:46,098
when we asked how could we make this
better that's where we got some really

638
00:41:46,098 --> 00:41:47,115
interesting feedback

639
00:41:48,015 --> 00:41:53,020
someone suggested they might want to be
able to the restaurant name

640
00:41:53,002 --> 00:41:57,076
while they're looking at the map another
person suggested they'd like to be able

641
00:41:57,094 --> 00:41:59,100
to see the map well they're looking at
the rating

642
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,005
perhaps they want to make their own
calculations love

643
00:42:03,005 --> 00:42:08,092
highest-rated the closest to was removed
really interesting

644
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:11,181
that the feedback and I think I'm going
to invite mark-up

645
00:42:12,081 --> 00:42:19,081
to discuss how we can explore these
interactively thank you

646
00:42:20,071 --> 00:42:24,106
good morning let's have a look at what
we've learned

647
00:42:25,006 --> 00:42:28,041
from the feedback so far what's working

648
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:31,047
the transition between the map

649
00:42:31,047 --> 00:42:34,119
and the list feel great do in showed us
how we can do some really cool

650
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:35,105
animations

651
00:42:36,005 --> 00:42:41,006
without writing a single line of code
what's not working

652
00:42:41,015 --> 00:42:44,066
you still have to switch between two
screens to get

653
00:42:44,066 --> 00:42:48,110
to all of the information about toast so
what other ideas

654
00:42:49,001 --> 00:42:52,024
does this give us well maybe

655
00:42:52,033 --> 00:42:55,130
we can put the map and the lid on the
screen

656
00:42:56,003 --> 00:43:01,060
at the same time and that

657
00:43:01,087 --> 00:43:05,168
a map on once-great

658
00:43:06,068 --> 00:43:10,129
great now we've got all the information

659
00:43:11,029 --> 00:43:15,056
accessible on once-great problem solved

660
00:43:15,056 --> 00:43:19,140
but wait a second if this really a good
idea

661
00:43:20,004 --> 00:43:24,042
if you think about it the map is only
hop up its origin of ice

662
00:43:24,078 --> 00:43:27,114
so with the lead we have to pan the map
more

663
00:43:28,014 --> 00:43:31,043
we have to scroll the list more in order
to access the fame

664
00:43:31,043 --> 00:43:38,043
number of information to figure out
whether it's the right thing we need to

665
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:39,083
be tried out

666
00:43:39,092 --> 00:43:43,150
and that's why we create an interactive
prototype we make another fake ap

667
00:43:44,005 --> 00:43:47,092
and we start off by asking what needs to
be more real

668
00:43:48,037 --> 00:43:52,041
finding nearby post on the map need to
be more real

669
00:43:52,041 --> 00:43:55,049
and scanning the list for the Best Coast
should be Maria

670
00:43:56,021 --> 00:43:59,022
you want to be able to pan the map and
scroll to this

671
00:43:59,022 --> 00:44:03,025
now what can we fake what can we do

672
00:44:03,025 --> 00:44:08,027
to speed up our process of making the
prototype we can fake

673
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:11,049
the map handle it by making using

674
00:44:11,085 --> 00:44:14,097
draggable images but more to more about
that later

675
00:44:14,097 --> 00:44:17,126
and where will we use

676
00:44:18,026 --> 00:44:21,119
a lap let's keep that up in in our mind
while we are creating

677
00:44:22,019 --> 00:44:25,085
of a cat and of course no case

678
00:44:25,085 --> 00:44:29,108
it's when we walk the streets of San
Francisco trying to find the hippest

679
00:44:30,008 --> 00:44:33,010
toast and tell now making fake ap

680
00:44:33,001 --> 00:44:36,085
it's really easy we're following one
principal guideline

681
00:44:36,094 --> 00:44:41,158
that is to make pictures move in
response to touch it and one more thing

682
00:44:42,058 --> 00:44:46,120
its to make pictures move in response to
touch it on the device

683
00:44:47,002 --> 00:44:50,101
that your prototyping for you

684
00:44:51,019 --> 00:44:54,023
whatever you want that can do that

685
00:44:54,023 --> 00:44:58,074
if you up from a web background check
accused html/css

686
00:44:58,074 --> 00:45:03,120
a bit of jQuery if your game developer
who happens to you unit unity3d

687
00:45:04,002 --> 00:45:07,063
it's another great program to make some
pictures move around

688
00:45:07,081 --> 00:45:10,112
in response to touch it or

689
00:45:11,012 --> 00:45:15,073
you could use sweat we are super excited
about swift

690
00:45:15,073 --> 00:45:18,081
but today we're going to use Co
animation

691
00:45:18,081 --> 00:45:21,115
and Xcode with objectivity this

692
00:45:22,015 --> 00:45:25,046
because that's what we've been using an
hour prototyping group so far

693
00:45:25,046 --> 00:45:30,051
quick word about writing code for a
prototype

694
00:45:30,051 --> 00:45:34,064
it's different from writing code for me
that

695
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:39,102
the idea is not to engineer at to pack
it together as quick as a cat

696
00:45:40,002 --> 00:45:43,060
it doesn't have to be good coat or
reusable code

697
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:46,070
because the idea if that make a
prototype to make a better decision

698
00:45:47,024 --> 00:45:49,109
about whether you really want to spend
the time

699
00:45:50,009 --> 00:45:54,092
engineering that we think

700
00:45:54,092 --> 00:45:59,111
we general you three steps to bird an
interactive prototype

701
00:46:00,011 --> 00:46:03,079
first step but the picture on the device

702
00:46:03,079 --> 00:46:06,098
once you have a picture on the device
it's a good indicator that you've got

703
00:46:06,098 --> 00:46:09,129
your work till sorted out

704
00:46:10,029 --> 00:46:14,113
second Sep break up the picture you want
to prepare the picture so you can apply

705
00:46:15,013 --> 00:46:16,032
interaction

706
00:46:16,032 --> 00:46:19,048
to selected areas on the screen

707
00:46:19,048 --> 00:46:22,147
and set that moved the pictures when you
touch them

708
00:46:23,047 --> 00:46:27,135
this is all about implementing the
interaction

709
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:31,100
alright first step get the picture on
the device

710
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,066
credo picture in Keynote and the one
thing we have to consider if that we

711
00:46:36,066 --> 00:46:36,072
work

712
00:46:37,026 --> 00:46:40,071
to the actual pixel dimensions of the
device

713
00:46:40,071 --> 00:46:43,119
we export our like as a PNG and save it

714
00:46:44,019 --> 00:46:48,112
into the for the structure of alexco
project

715
00:46:49,012 --> 00:46:52,065
now it's time to write a little bit of
code and what you see here

716
00:46:52,065 --> 00:46:55,090
the setup function in a class costs
create

717
00:46:55,009 --> 00:46:59,058
now another class to be with the Lord in
all cases the Costco player

718
00:47:00,039 --> 00:47:03,055
and for those of you who know about
coordination in

719
00:47:03,055 --> 00:47:07,055
it simply just inherits from you I
ImageView site also has got all the

720
00:47:07,055 --> 00:47:09,147
functionality of you live you

721
00:47:10,047 --> 00:47:13,089
all we did it at a little bit of
convenience functions

722
00:47:13,089 --> 00:47:16,106
a to make a lot you get a position as a
a

723
00:47:17,006 --> 00:47:21,028
and to load an image into that layer

724
00:47:21,028 --> 00:47:24,030
by the default we have lacquered screen

725
00:47:24,003 --> 00:47:27,077
it stretches across the whole of the
physical screen

726
00:47:28,004 --> 00:47:31,035
and so to get a picture onto a screen
week rate and I'll

727
00:47:31,035 --> 00:47:34,100
and another layer called picture and
without

728
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,019
our image into into it

729
00:47:38,019 --> 00:47:41,033
that's it we press play

730
00:47:41,033 --> 00:47:45,084
next coat and hit it

731
00:47:45,084 --> 00:47:51,165
of first fake at looks pretty re already
done that

732
00:47:52,065 --> 00:47:56,087
thanks right let's get on second step

733
00:47:56,087 --> 00:47:59,090
you want to break up the picture in our
case

734
00:48:00,017 --> 00:48:03,114
we break it up into another occasion bar
into an image of a list

735
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:09,015
and an image of a map let's start with
the lead

736
00:48:09,015 --> 00:48:13,043
I use keynote again and Linda showed how
you can really quickly create

737
00:48:13,043 --> 00:48:18,126
take much of it now this time we want to
apply some interaction to the american

738
00:48:19,026 --> 00:48:22,030
we want to be able to scroll they met up
and down

739
00:48:22,066 --> 00:48:25,112
so that make sure that is much longer
than the screen height

740
00:48:26,012 --> 00:48:30,095
or device

741
00:48:30,095 --> 00:48:34,178
next thing we want to create a fake
image of a map

742
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:39,154
where do I get it from we improvise a
little bit

743
00:48:40,054 --> 00:48:43,111
I've got the eye with 10 laps up I open
it up make it full screen take a

744
00:48:44,011 --> 00:48:45,014
screenshot

745
00:48:45,014 --> 00:48:48,020
put it into keynote and there it is

746
00:48:48,002 --> 00:48:52,007
we also want to display feature at toast
on the map

747
00:48:52,025 --> 00:48:56,119
so sprinkle a few I can on told my toast
map

748
00:48:57,019 --> 00:49:01,025
kind of an partisan away no need to be
precise

749
00:49:01,025 --> 00:49:05,086
work with latitude longitude values just
get it done

750
00:49:05,086 --> 00:49:10,105
again make sure it's large enough so we
can implement some track behavior on it

751
00:49:11,005 --> 00:49:15,063
and possible what here we have or three
discrete images

752
00:49:15,063 --> 00:49:20,132
now it's time to rearrange the images so
they become one screen again

753
00:49:21,032 --> 00:49:24,103
them public coat crate they're called
map a lot my map image

754
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:28,090
position is love roughly crater another
lift

755
00:49:28,009 --> 00:49:31,063
layup while air cordless rather

756
00:49:32,044 --> 00:49:35,058
and the time I'm gonna position at
roughly down

757
00:49:35,058 --> 00:49:41,080
hop of the screen height and I me that
actually okay had already left my map

758
00:49:41,008 --> 00:49:44,009
and so does the navigation bar at the
top

759
00:49:44,081 --> 00:49:47,112
call we are ready to go

760
00:49:48,012 --> 00:49:52,025
let's make some pictures move when you
touch them

761
00:49:52,025 --> 00:49:56,083
I want to talk to you about at the track
misbehavior

762
00:49:56,083 --> 00:49:59,115
what happens is you hit the map

763
00:50:00,015 --> 00:50:05,091
a touchdown event happens then you move
your finger

764
00:50:05,091 --> 00:50:08,097
and you get serious of touch movie then

765
00:50:09,051 --> 00:50:12,089
on and on each touch with you and we
actually moving

766
00:50:12,089 --> 00:50:15,808
the underlying image with that and the
last event

767
00:50:16,609 --> 00:50:22,180
is a touch-up event lift-off my thing up

768
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:25,197
now in order to make an image mu we

769
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:28,410
essentially go into it well within

770
00:50:28,041 --> 00:50:32,053
each touch movie then week ended Oct the
death for translation between the

771
00:50:32,053 --> 00:50:33,110
previous touch position

772
00:50:34,001 --> 00:50:37,003
and the current touch position that's
what we use

773
00:50:37,012 --> 00:50:41,069
to move the image the problem becomes
more clear

774
00:50:41,069 --> 00:50:44,078
in Cote so this is a bit of

775
00:50:44,078 --> 00:50:48,080
this the coat block that get call it
every time a touch movie event happens

776
00:50:48,008 --> 00:50:51,069
on on that play a

777
00:50:52,041 --> 00:50:55,074
what we do that 3 ghetto a touch of Jack

778
00:50:55,074 --> 00:50:58,077
from that we can retreat the current
touch position and the previous touch

779
00:50:59,004 --> 00:51:01,027
position

780
00:51:01,027 --> 00:51:04,035
and we calculate or Delta Pi subtracting
the previous

781
00:51:05,007 --> 00:51:08,042
but tough position from the current
touch position

782
00:51:08,042 --> 00:51:11,054
and added to on that position

783
00:51:11,054 --> 00:51:14,118
and we do the same thing for the lead
but in this case we only applied to

784
00:51:15,018 --> 00:51:16,079
translation to the y coordinate

785
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:19,133
cause we're just going up and down

786
00:51:20,033 --> 00:51:23,080
quick look at how it looks like court we
can track the

787
00:51:23,008 --> 00:51:27,107
the map and we can scroll the list

788
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:31,142
now we've cheated a bit here you can
feel a bit of inertia and the author

789
00:51:32,042 --> 00:51:32,127
constraining

790
00:51:33,027 --> 00:51:37,080
the movement with a bit of a spring
behavior if you're interested in that

791
00:51:37,008 --> 00:51:41,090
you can download black spot project
after the session

792
00:51:42,062 --> 00:51:46,065
let's move on want to divert a little
bit

793
00:51:46,092 --> 00:51:49,165
to the a the part of our prototype

794
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:54,072
well we can share toast for the idea to
take a picture of you toasty at a little

795
00:51:55,035 --> 00:51:56,077
bit of information

796
00:51:56,077 --> 00:51:59,078
and then he posted best thing is

797
00:51:59,087 --> 00:52:02,096
I need a camera P

798
00:52:02,096 --> 00:52:05,140
for now I just hide it at the lateral to
screen

799
00:52:06,004 --> 00:52:10,012
and no I need to bottom but I realized
then already created

800
00:52:10,048 --> 00:52:15,052
love the plus button in my navigation
bar

801
00:52:15,052 --> 00:52:18,144
so why do with i hook up a touch-up
event onto my navigation bar

802
00:52:19,044 --> 00:52:23,077
and so when you tap that poss pattern it
were true got this line of code

803
00:52:23,077 --> 00:52:26,081
which and make the camera image back in

804
00:52:26,081 --> 00:52:30,133
and this is just an example of how your
code doesn't have to be beautiful

805
00:52:31,033 --> 00:52:37,059
but we can to pack 6 together with what
you've got on the screen

806
00:52:37,059 --> 00:52:42,075
it s have to Talk button you see the
camera image

807
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:45,081
now so probably that there was a live
camera preview

808
00:52:46,035 --> 00:52:49,050
we added that to at a little bit of
reno's to it

809
00:52:49,005 --> 00:52:53,028
but that's why we stop when you press
what hap the shutter button

810
00:52:53,073 --> 00:52:57,160
we've we switch to a fake image of the
toast

811
00:52:58,006 --> 00:53:01,065
and that's what we continue with yet a
few

812
00:53:02,019 --> 00:53:08,033
a information about your toast and
posted

813
00:53:08,033 --> 00:53:13,041
now how did we do the keyboard typing
sequence

814
00:53:14,013 --> 00:53:17,101
probably already gave it away of course

815
00:53:18,001 --> 00:53:22,048
we just use a sequence of images

816
00:53:22,048 --> 00:53:24,141
I didn't bother about using any dynamic
textfield or

817
00:53:25,041 --> 00:53:28,117
a key but siding and I did all of the
images

818
00:53:29,017 --> 00:53:33,041
just from one flight in Keynote and this
brings us back actually to what we

819
00:53:33,041 --> 00:53:33,117
actually do it

820
00:53:34,017 --> 00:53:38,044
we're creating a prototype by making
pictures

821
00:53:38,044 --> 00:53:42,047
move in response to touch this me doing
that

822
00:53:42,047 --> 00:53:46,110
to help us make better decisions about
whether we really want to pursue

823
00:53:47,001 --> 00:53:50,077
idea and part of this decision making
process

824
00:53:50,086 --> 00:53:53,150
it to show you a prototype to people

825
00:53:54,005 --> 00:53:58,008
and if it's an interactive prototype
it's really important that you let

826
00:53:58,008 --> 00:53:59,030
people tried out

827
00:54:00,002 --> 00:54:03,041
with as little explanation as possible
the first impressions are really

828
00:54:03,041 --> 00:54:03,048
important

829
00:54:04,011 --> 00:54:09,023
look at what people are struggling with
the interactions like a crater

830
00:54:09,023 --> 00:54:12,042
and also look at what they liked them

831
00:54:12,042 --> 00:54:16,111
and of some questions like to know how
to fight nearby toast

832
00:54:17,011 --> 00:54:20,013
atop toast the value your feedback

833
00:54:20,031 --> 00:54:24,080
if the one which is Kritika if they tell
us on the map and the

834
00:54:24,008 --> 00:54:27,050
say there something we didn't really
think about

835
00:54:28,022 --> 00:54:31,053
when we had a genius idea of putting the
map

836
00:54:31,053 --> 00:54:36,056
and the list on 213 something we should
result before we built the real say

837
00:54:36,056 --> 00:54:39,108
is that you to explore toast

838
00:54:40,008 --> 00:54:43,056
it's another good question and of

839
00:54:43,056 --> 00:54:48,058
for suggestions how can we make this
better I wish I could sort it out in a

840
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:49,084
few more different way

841
00:54:49,084 --> 00:54:52,127
yeah I make sense not everyone wants to
spend

842
00:54:53,027 --> 00:54:58,042
for dollars or more for a slice of bread
but this way I want to read

843
00:54:58,042 --> 00:55:02,070
introduced to to summarize all session
had concluded

844
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:09,007
thank you thank you mark so we learned
some very important things for marketing

845
00:55:10,097 --> 00:55:10,190
director predator

846
00:55:11,009 --> 00:55:16,026
quick recap

847
00:55:17,007 --> 00:55:21,034
do much better then we saw how the
pictures work together

848
00:55:21,034 --> 00:55:25,126
using from animation and then we built
an interactive prototype we could see

849
00:55:26,026 --> 00:55:28,031
have a whole thing work together in our
hand

850
00:55:28,031 --> 00:55:31,084
now couple quick comparisons to hit the
town

851
00:55:31,084 --> 00:55:34,121
the screen on the raid takes lot a real
code

852
00:55:35,021 --> 00:55:38,085
for our prototype all we did was move a
picture around in 2d

853
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:41,144
removalist up and down that was really
quick this

854
00:55:42,044 --> 00:55:46,048
Greenview a toast we're taking home in
true real code for our prototype

855
00:55:46,084 --> 00:55:50,089
we just made a quick drying which with
enough to realize that this concept

856
00:55:51,034 --> 00:55:51,093
sucked

857
00:55:51,093 --> 00:55:54,129
what we learned today

858
00:55:55,029 --> 00:55:58,118
well we prototype a picture and we learn
how to take screenshots map

859
00:55:59,018 --> 00:56:03,095
women to rearrange them so we can make a
lot of different options we prototyped

860
00:56:03,095 --> 00:56:03,146
with

861
00:56:04,046 --> 00:56:07,046
animation me learn how to animate
pictures

862
00:56:07,046 --> 00:56:11,069
using magic move in keno we could see a
different screens work together

863
00:56:11,069 --> 00:56:15,070
and we prototype with interaction

864
00:56:15,007 --> 00:56:18,036
and we made pictures move on the screen
a response to touches

865
00:56:18,099 --> 00:56:22,141
so we can see how the whole thing felt
together why do we do this

866
00:56:23,041 --> 00:56:26,092
to resume hope your member number one of
the test ideas

867
00:56:26,092 --> 00:56:29,151
and number two if to get new ideas and
how do we do it

868
00:56:30,051 --> 00:56:33,129
this one I really hope you guys remember
make recap

869
00:56:34,029 --> 00:56:37,105
show people and learn from their
feedback

870
00:56:38,005 --> 00:56:42,067
and do that over and over again until
the expiry in Figure ap

871
00:56:42,067 --> 00:56:46,068
feels great so here's what I want all
the view

872
00:56:46,068 --> 00:56:50,085
to go into you near if you're a
developer to company

873
00:56:50,085 --> 00:56:53,157
I want you to tell your management the
prototyping fifth time and money

874
00:56:54,057 --> 00:56:59,061
by helping you build the right thing if
you're a solo developer

875
00:56:59,061 --> 00:57:05,095
I want you to draw animated hack before
you go and build something and if you

876
00:57:05,095 --> 00:57:06,117
can code it all

877
00:57:07,017 --> 00:57:11,018
again thank you for coming draw and
animate

878
00:57:11,018 --> 00:57:14,042
you don't need code yet but the person
next to you might be able to help you

879
00:57:14,042 --> 00:57:14,109
with that part

880
00:57:15,009 --> 00:57:18,052
designers don't just drop pictures

881
00:57:18,052 --> 00:57:21,147
also make animated and interactive
things to fully understand your design

882
00:57:22,047 --> 00:57:25,085
in our management types we've

883
00:57:25,085 --> 00:57:32,085
going make time for your designers and
engineers to put it thank you

884
00:57:37,065 --> 00:57:41,094
there's a lot to Turkey code on the web
got a ghetto thank you very much

885
00:57:41,094 --> 00:57:41,136
everybody
