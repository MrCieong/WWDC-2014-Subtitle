42
00:02:42,001 --> 00:02:46,065
right now means pretty

43
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:50,324
alright so on the store on the store
front page you can have description tax

44
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:52,995
you have other information but you know
a picture is worth a thousand words

45
00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:57,280
let's look at the screen shot and
they're beautiful are beautiful and

46
00:02:57,028 --> 00:02:57,115
gorgeous

47
00:02:58,015 --> 00:03:03,664
is an amazing app but I'm curious as a
customer I don't fully understand it I

48
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:05,040
don't understand how the app

49
00:03:05,004 --> 00:03:11,059
functions this is out previews so if a
picture is worth a thousand words

50
00:03:11,059 --> 00:03:14,106
what's a video or and this is a

51
00:03:15,006 --> 00:03:22,006
the

52
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:29,093
the moment

53
00:03:29,093 --> 00:03:33,093
aunt

54
00:03:33,093 --> 00:03:34,097
on

55
00:03:34,097 --> 00:03:37,120
in

56
00:03:38,002 --> 00:03:45,002
the

57
00:03:45,081 --> 00:03:49,081
right before our eyes Monument Valley
becomes immersive

58
00:03:49,081 --> 00:03:52,135
puzzle game and you make an immediate
emotional connection

59
00:03:53,035 --> 00:03:56,100
and that's app reviews solar start of

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,096
goes on the same page was just some
basic information

61
00:04:00,096 --> 00:04:04,105
up app reviews up to thirty seconds in
length

62
00:04:05,005 --> 00:04:10,061
app reviews are not really brand or
campaign focused

63
00:04:10,061 --> 00:04:13,147
they are the raffle with cutscenes
they're definitely not the actual

64
00:04:14,047 --> 00:04:16,139
trailers the just brief videos meant to
demonstrate

65
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:20,067

126
00:07:58,005 --> 00:07:58,082
about your app

127
00:07:58,082 --> 00:08:01,134

about planning planning is the biggest

128
00:08:02,034 --> 00:08:04,923
part about making your app review the
restroom it really easy so

129
00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:08,460
planning is where you have to start

130
00:08:08,046 --> 00:08:11,075
first you have to figure out the goal

131
00:08:11,075 --> 00:08:14,304
love your app review are you highlight

132
00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:18,990
feature many features maybe

133
00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:22,150
the utility of your app maybe you have a
really innovative you are I

134
00:08:23,005 --> 00:08:27,914
start thinking about what your goal
under thirty second app reviews gonna be

135
00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:32,620
and agree way to think about this is
what makes my app

136
00:08:32,062 --> 00:08:35,541
magical what makes bad magic and

137
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:39,500
an easy way to kind of put yourself in
that that question is

138
00:08:39,005 --> 00:08:42,010
if somebody walked up to you with your
app you know

139
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:45,084
hey I've got this app you're out what

elements may be left out the elements

157
00:09:44,022 --> 00:09:46,029
that you want to put in your app review

158
00:09:46,092 --> 00:09:49,131
a if your app it's already on store a
great place to start five-year

159
00:09:50,031 --> 00:09:51,092
description text

160
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:54,701
that's probably first list the event
everyone who got to listen your

161
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:58,190
description text right now you just feel
that

162
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:01,037
put that on your list number add to it
serves for

163
00:10:01,037 --> 00:10:04,081
playing with things start thinking about
what your app is all about our

164
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:07,088
our marriage spent so much time on this
great level i really wanna show this of

165
00:10:08,051 --> 00:10:11,087
kids love this target so much feedback
about this portion of my app that's a

166
00:10:11,087 --> 00:10:13,145
great thing to put in my app review

167
00:10:14,045 --> 00:10:18,060
and I having so that now I highly
encourage you

168
00:10:18,006 --> 00:10:21,065
to make some kinda outline a storyboard
you see the storm or that we have upon

169
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:23,042
your on-screen

170
00:10:23,042 --> 00:10:26,095
this is first order we're essentially a
previous based on

171
00:10:26,095 --> 00:10:29,101
a little bit but it's nothing fancy
don't retreat charles is

172
00:10:30,055 --> 00:10:33,079
fantastic drying arm they could be on a
napkin

173
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:36,131
mutually napkin are you know I doesn't
matter what you do when you're trying to

174
00:10:37,031 --> 00:10:40,102
make a beat a series of a rose in boxes
but for storyboarding it out

175
00:10:41,002 --> 00:10:45,036
what do what do I wanna show in my video
how am I gonna put the story together

176
00:10:45,036 --> 00:10:48,054
right arm along those lines

177
00:10:48,054 --> 00:10:51,133
you prolly wanna work with that list
developments your storyboard

178
00:10:52,033 --> 00:10:55,057
start working with the timing remember
you're fine I'm outta time

179
00:10:55,057 --> 00:10:58,132
same I like this oh man I really wanna
show of this you are that takes about

180
00:10:59,032 --> 00:11:00,097
five seconds to load

181
00:11:00,097 --> 00:11:04,156
start work with the timing here this is
the time in the planning stage knowing a

182
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:06,850
bar down the production stage

183
00:11:06,085 --> 00:11:08,824
you know you working on the on on your
app review and still not know what

184
00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:12,250
you're trying to accomplish by

185
00:11:12,025 --> 00:11:16,051
so for the planning stage miserable
basic things went on time here but

186
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:19,106
I think it's good reminder 1 I'll get
you you are the weeds if you if you're

187
00:11:20,006 --> 00:11:21,008
if you're the production's

188
00:11:21,008 --> 00:11:24,020
process one last thing are contemplating

189
00:11:24,002 --> 00:11:28,061
just like screenshots yet to disclose
all your in app purchase

190
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,105
so that's a good time in your planning
stage to figure how you gonna do that

191
00:11:32,005 --> 00:11:35,092
if your gonna show the you know the sort
of thunder

192
00:11:35,092 --> 00:11:39,101
and that cost 10,000 coins are you
either have to figure out how to

193
00:11:40,001 --> 00:11:42,069
disclose that with some kind of texture
all meant

194
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:45,132
or maybe you want to show how the in app
purchase

195
00:11:46,032 --> 00:11:49,129
was purchased in your and your app
review so memory of the

196
00:11:50,029 --> 00:11:54,328
it disclose all your purchases plan for
it

197
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:59,470
good tip alright couple technical things
to go over

198
00:11:59,047 --> 00:12:02,124
if your universal app you have a great
story more

199
00:12:03,024 --> 00:12:06,120
might have a great plan above your iPad
app

200
00:12:07,002 --> 00:12:10,038
and your iPad version A in your iPhone
version may have different UI elements

201
00:12:10,056 --> 00:12:13,525
that you want a highly or need to
highlight or capturing a different way

202
00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:17,980
to edit into your app review in the
planning phase good to identify those so

203
00:12:17,098 --> 00:12:17,163
you can

204
00:12:18,063 --> 00:12:21,112
capture them when you need them to help
them endure production process

205
00:12:22,012 --> 00:12:25,013
on next one 0

206
00:12:25,013 --> 00:12:28,038
this is a good one arm

207
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:31,107
you know your customers past and so
therefore we're gonna allow you to pick

208
00:12:31,449 --> 00:12:31,487
your

209
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:35,886
language for ya preview remember it goes
on your app's primary localization but

210
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,110
you need to choose a language now

211
00:12:38,011 --> 00:12:41,025
yet again you know your customers past
if your app's

212
00:12:41,025 --> 00:12:46,073
primary localizations Japanese as
primarily sold in Japan

213
00:12:46,073 --> 00:12:50,081
but yet you know that your customers
expecting English video:

214
00:12:50,081 --> 00:12:53,142
as long as a passive guidelines were
gonna allow it so the planning phases

215
00:12:54,042 --> 00:12:54,141
good figure out

216
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:59,770
language in use this is probably the
most obvious thing I'm gonna tell you

217
00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:01,720
today but demo counts

218
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:05,111
if you're up opens up to a login screens
from your really boring app review

219
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:08,820
so republicanism I have demo counts you
know

220
00:13:08,082 --> 00:13:11,149
hand along those lines you may need to
stage some information

221
00:13:12,049 --> 00:13:16,050
into those accounts I if your social
opportunities within social media editor

222
00:13:16,005 --> 00:13:17,093
Kyle Drabek gonna need to put some

223
00:13:18,038 --> 00:13:22,049
calendar information if you're a gay man
you really want to show off that fourth

224
00:13:22,049 --> 00:13:22,144
level that you

225
00:13:23,044 --> 00:13:26,093
you know kids really love you have to
figure out a way to get that fourth

226
00:13:26,093 --> 00:13:26,166
level

227
00:13:27,066 --> 00:13:31,080
and I caution you don't stage anything
in your app review that cannot be

228
00:13:31,008 --> 00:13:31,016
accomplished

229
00:13:32,006 --> 00:13:35,075
in your app your app review has to be
representative the app the customer will

230
00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:36,036
buy

231
00:13:36,099 --> 00:13:39,131
just a caution and unknown menu doesn't
do that but it just want to warn you

232
00:13:40,031 --> 00:13:40,113
about that

233
00:13:41,013 --> 00:13:44,016
also are in staging goodyear

234
00:13:44,016 --> 00:13:48,505
about just like screenshots we can have
any advertisements in their previous set

235
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:51,620
to get under stage those out

236
00:13:51,062 --> 00:13:54,721
hunger alright but show you a cool app
review now

237
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,690
for me talk this is a preview for our

238
00:13:59,069 --> 00:14:02,161
our friends at from from a friend to
talk about her for an app

239
00:14:03,061 --> 00:14:08,066
call to collapse and they just have put
a few capture clips together

240
00:14:09,011 --> 00:14:13,036
they demonstrate their quirky art
direction and they're fine you are I

241
00:14:13,036 --> 00:14:16,099
this is not to get kids really involved
in experimentation in science

242
00:14:16,099 --> 00:14:19,128
just give you a great picture the app in
a brief amount of time

243
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:25,970
love to show it to you right now

244
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:31,146

please proper talk about her come on

250
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:59,093
that's a great app review just a series
of clips is very basic

251
00:14:59,093 --> 00:15:02,622
my kids addicted to these actual loves
loves them alright

252
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:06,465
now or move on

253
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:11,920
my favorite part about this the capture
near really expensive cable for this

254
00:15:11,092 --> 00:15:14,094
really lots worked on killing ya you
just a lightning cable

255
00:15:14,094 --> 00:15:19,603
its made it so easy amazing alright a
couple things like after

256
00:15:20,449 --> 00:15:23,980
no estan is seventy and I was a

257
00:15:23,098 --> 00:15:26,507
you gonna be able to you hook up your
device via a lightning cable

258
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:30,940
writes your Mac open a QuickTime Player
and your devices

259
00:15:30,094 --> 00:15:33,188
screen output and audio are available as
inputs

260
00:15:34,088 --> 00:15:40,837
just like a camera would be yes there
you go the yeah

261
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:44,631
through breezy I love it I love it

262
00:15:44,829 --> 00:15:50,790
fantastic alright so to do this
obviously

263
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,106
you need I S devices require lightning
cables Fletcher

264
00:15:54,006 --> 00:15:58,345
iPod touches your iPhone 5 Series your
iPad

265
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:03,050
near the lightning cable support only
works over lightning

266
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:06,354
but and true Apple form it just works

267
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,370
a special molds no clicking no shaking
an overhead

268
00:16:10,037 --> 00:16:13,061
stop on it three times that works its
plugin

269
00:16:13,061 --> 00:16:16,540
selecting quick time we're gonna show it
to you today it's it's really amazing

270
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:22,120
just works love that couple tips for
capture

271
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:27,620
arm we want to display the highest
quality video and audio to the customers

272
00:16:27,062 --> 00:16:30,124
and so we're we've made this capture
tool so that you can capture the highest

273
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:33,053
quality video and audio love your app

274
00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:36,980
you spend a lot of time making
perfecting every pixel in your you I

275
00:16:36,098 --> 00:16:38,147
know we want to capture every single
pixel

276
00:16:39,047 --> 00:16:42,466
the end make sure the customer sees how
much how much love and you know

277
00:16:42,889 --> 00:16:44,420
everything you put into your apt

278
00:16:44,042 --> 00:16:48,043
so we're hoping that you can use these
Apple tools

279
00:16:48,043 --> 00:16:51,872
on a tip just like toca Boca did there
you can start

280
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:55,500
your capture are you looking at it in
from your splash screen

281
00:16:55,005 --> 00:16:59,144
looks really kinda cool if you want but
please don't capture street from the

282
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:02,663
home screen going into your aperture app
has

283
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:06,280
in her apt operability door switch back
and forth between

284
00:17:06,028 --> 00:17:09,029
aP's this is about you're single app

285
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:14,038
its functions let it shine capture only
your app

286
00:17:14,038 --> 00:17:19,247
go-slow I know that thirty seconds scary
to some EU but really you can make some

287
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:21,900
amazing app reviews were showing a
really awesome

288
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:24,018
couple awesome 32nd previous second
go-slow

289
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:26,178
if your customer care follow along with
what you're doing they're not going to

290
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:27,174
understand

291
00:17:28,074 --> 00:17:30,120
your app review that I can understand
your appetite probably gonna be

292
00:17:31,002 --> 00:17:35,007
discouraged by its a go-slow use
intentional move smooth move

293
00:17:35,025 --> 00:17:38,031
moves smooth Moves you know

294
00:17:38,085 --> 00:17:41,177
and there's no filmer anything to load
into the scare earlier only limitation

295
00:17:42,077 --> 00:17:44,082
is your hard drives over her set retake
it

296
00:17:45,027 --> 00:17:48,110
you know if your flow bitten do you try
and continue on don't don't know

297
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:53,029
just stop retake for her said retake it
you're planning a time

298
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:57,047
make a look right this is a face that's
now going on your apt you know for 30

299
00:17:58,028 --> 00:17:59,103
seconds for your customers to see

300
00:18:00,003 --> 00:18:03,007
so her street a caps you know take some
time

301
00:18:03,043 --> 00:18:07,061
along those lines I wanna show you a
really cool app review

302
00:18:07,061 --> 00:18:10,118
this app reviews of our friends up to
you

303
00:18:11,018 --> 00:18:15,025
a2z countering ap that I deals with the
different levels of events

304
00:18:15,025 --> 00:18:19,104
in your life and what they've done is a
example what we like to call a one take

305
00:18:20,004 --> 00:18:24,101
and seven and in clips together they've
literally taken a 1-1 take

306
00:18:25,001 --> 00:18:29,077
shot at their app review click Record
about a couple graphics on the front to

307
00:18:29,077 --> 00:18:29,114
back

308
00:18:30,014 --> 00:18:33,087
but they click Record and they go
through nice smooth intentional

309
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,118
movements that populate it with a lot of

310
00:18:36,018 --> 00:18:39,073
a you know data they've stage their app
really well

311
00:18:39,073 --> 00:18:43,119
and in their one take video you get a
great picture above the innovative you I

312
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:51,019
for their calendar app show it to you
right now milk

313
00:19:17,049 --> 00:19:24,049
awesome right never listen to the music
may just it's got this great feel you

314
00:19:27,005 --> 00:19:27,046
got you

315
00:19:27,046 --> 00:19:31,101
get the whole app thirty-seconds
fantastic which is a great segue into

316
00:19:32,001 --> 00:19:37,018
are compositions action couple tips on
composition

317
00:19:37,018 --> 00:19:41,020
you've been developing a route for days
weeks months years

318
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:45,087
you know a lot about your out well
because we're probably doesn't have the

319
00:19:45,087 --> 00:19:45,181
same perspective

320
00:19:46,081 --> 00:19:50,144
so when you're making your app review
think about their perspective you gonna

321
00:19:51,044 --> 00:19:54,122
garage them with a bunch of information
are assumptions about what are your app

322
00:19:55,022 --> 00:19:55,029
does

323
00:19:55,092 --> 00:19:58,160
there might be confused maybe put off so
think about your customer's perspective

324
00:19:59,006 --> 00:20:02,098
and you know this is a great great tip
is you know use your friends and family

325
00:20:03,052 --> 00:20:04,134
are you ever your office

326
00:20:05,034 --> 00:20:08,091
show your offer a preview of and look at
look for what their

327
00:20:08,091 --> 00:20:11,096
feedback is you know see if there's
something missing

328
00:20:11,096 --> 00:20:14,138
your story as you might have something
in your head that you're somebody else

329
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:15,137
doesn't have in their ad

330
00:20:16,037 --> 00:20:20,041
this is a a common mistake a very very
common mistake

331
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:24,048
gonna put taxed up on the screen you
need to put it up there long enough for

332
00:20:25,011 --> 00:20:25,088
people to read it

333
00:20:25,088 --> 00:20:29,119
people do this all the time that
protects up on the screen they don't

334
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:30,061
make it

335
00:20:30,061 --> 00:20:34,137
value lead gone for you can read it so
make sure she throwing text up there

336
00:20:35,037 --> 00:20:40,115
allow people to Rieger taxed miss want
easy for me cuz I'm always positive stay

337
00:20:41,015 --> 00:20:42,044
positive

338
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:46,760
there's no worse sales pitch than a
negative sales pitch this is about your

339
00:20:46,076 --> 00:20:46,165
app

340
00:20:47,065 --> 00:20:50,071
and why your app is the past or why your
app is

341
00:20:50,071 --> 00:20:54,139
awesome so don't imply anything about
other applications is keeping about your

342
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,085
app and stay positive

343
00:20:56,085 --> 00:21:01,159
missus this is real opportunity for your
apt to shine more tips

344
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:05,116
you may be a cross platform developer

345
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:09,109
after this thirty seconds are all App
Store so go ahead

346
00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:13,032
relief of those platform logo's in fact

347
00:21:13,032 --> 00:21:16,073
we've of the App Store logo use the 32nd
30

348
00:21:16,073 --> 00:21:20,102
we like our largest unwanted fine these
are your thirty seconds

349
00:21:21,002 --> 00:21:25,055
leave off the platform logos you might
have

350
00:21:25,055 --> 00:21:29,080
this great idea new for spring

351
00:21:29,008 --> 00:21:32,016
in your app review and then

352
00:21:32,088 --> 00:21:35,150
you know you think you can upload a new
binary a couple new preview

353
00:21:36,005 --> 00:21:39,054
and I your CAC its sector your car
breaks down

354
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:42,106
and its eight months later and its
winter

355
00:21:43,006 --> 00:21:48,012
whatever season and now it says new for
spring and it makes absolutely no sense

356
00:21:48,066 --> 00:21:52,130
so keep a timeless lawyer up you just to
be about your app in some kind of

357
00:21:53,003 --> 00:21:54,035
neutral time-space

358
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:57,114
34 transitions

359
00:21:58,014 --> 00:22:01,045
I love a star wipe or pardon or

360
00:22:01,045 --> 00:22:04,084
or contrary as much as the next guy

361
00:22:04,084 --> 00:22:07,177
remember this is about your app so
stream for transitions are really

362
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:11,094
recommended when you're making app
review

363
00:22:11,094 --> 00:22:14,151
on three French transitions we actually
found just in our task actually

364
00:22:15,051 --> 00:22:16,059
sometimes be confusing though

365
00:22:17,031 --> 00:22:20,096
Arjun cuts is what we recommend for
everyone you see large on cuts here and

366
00:22:20,096 --> 00:22:21,315
I'll show you a couple or

367
00:22:22,179 --> 00:22:26,330
approves the have a great John cuts but
in a couple situations we notice that

368
00:22:26,033 --> 00:22:29,130
in junk cutting you can imply that your
app does something the app doesn't

369
00:22:30,003 --> 00:22:31,021
actually do

370
00:22:31,048 --> 00:22:35,081
so another great story for transitions
like a dissolve or a feedthrough collar

371
00:22:35,081 --> 00:22:38,134
to give your user oh okay this is

372
00:22:39,034 --> 00:22:43,034
a fade to another clip make sure you
don't fly the your app does something

373
00:22:43,034 --> 00:22:43,122
that it does not

374
00:22:44,022 --> 00:22:48,095
don't confuse our customers we love our
customers my last point is

375
00:22:48,095 --> 00:22:52,158
remember the tone these are in your face
marketing videos

376
00:22:53,058 --> 00:23:00,058
is just simple short app usage videos
they're fantastic remember the tone

377
00:23:00,073 --> 00:23:04,078
alright this is my things to avoid slide
above my deep serious voice

378
00:23:05,023 --> 00:23:10,069
for this alright thanks to avoid that's
not answers door

379
00:23:10,069 --> 00:23:14,103
linking crazy flashing loud obnoxious
things

380
00:23:15,003 --> 00:23:19,081
this is that the nineties in these are
banner ads

381
00:23:19,081 --> 00:23:22,129
after watching your up preview their RD
on your product page they've already

382
00:23:23,029 --> 00:23:26,029
click Play you don't need a gimmick to
draw them in

383
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:30,084
leave keep it simple you don't have to
do this

384
00:23:30,084 --> 00:23:34,913
pricing I if you're a pricing in your
video it's going to law it's gonna be

385
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:39,060
gonna put you in a corner I member your

386
00:23:39,006 --> 00:23:42,071
got a preview or your app is sold
internationally you may put your app on

387
00:23:42,071 --> 00:23:45,113
sale one day if you block yourself into
pricing in your video talking to make

388
00:23:46,013 --> 00:23:46,087
any sense

389
00:23:46,087 --> 00:23:49,175
leave the pricing out is a good display
in your product page product page RDS

390
00:23:50,075 --> 00:23:50,151
pricing

391
00:23:51,051 --> 00:23:57,055
already a storefront base pricing leave
the pricing for the product page

392
00:23:57,091 --> 00:24:00,114
are local

393
00:24:01,014 --> 00:24:05,041
yeah I you know at local cloak ilysm
means things like that

394
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:08,054
I references to Game of Thrones that I
don't even understand I don't watch the

395
00:24:08,054 --> 00:24:08,122
show

396
00:24:09,022 --> 00:24:13,057
probably only one who doesn't arm but
this is my route preview

397
00:24:13,057 --> 00:24:17,062
it's not about a anything that's going
on in the media nowadays so just keep it

398
00:24:18,007 --> 00:24:18,091
about your app

399
00:24:18,091 --> 00:24:21,170
keep it simple here's a big one

400
00:24:22,007 --> 00:24:25,020
can't put anything that's just like
screenshot just like your app

401
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:28,106
can't put anything in your app review
that you don't have the rights to use

402
00:24:29,006 --> 00:24:33,102
this includes but isn't limited to
imagery or photography year tax

403
00:24:34,002 --> 00:24:39,073
or sounds and music or videos if you
don't have the rights to use it

404
00:24:39,073 --> 00:24:44,129
do not put it in your app review right
there was a series is gonna get

405
00:24:45,029 --> 00:24:48,047
one thing we had in here rocks a lot of
questions on it

406
00:24:48,047 --> 00:24:51,052
narration absolutely

407
00:24:51,052 --> 00:24:56,105
a powerful tool if used correctly so
here's a couple tips

408
00:24:57,005 --> 00:25:00,077
there is an incredible voice-over
community out there

409
00:25:00,077 --> 00:25:04,083
look for them they're they're so
talented use professional voices

410
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:07,090
not everyone has the intonation and
clarity

411
00:25:07,009 --> 00:25:12,091
for voiceover work obviously I don't you
on

412
00:25:13,072 --> 00:25:16,281
remember this is a voice now this is the
voice in your absence choose your words

413
00:25:16,929 --> 00:25:18,310
wisely

414
00:25:18,031 --> 00:25:21,066
the second one is use professional
equipment

415
00:25:21,066 --> 00:25:24,107
it's available everywhere are condenser
mic spot filters

416
00:25:25,007 --> 00:25:29,040
just recording studios in general quiet
rooms but nobody wants their listen to

417
00:25:29,004 --> 00:25:30,022
an app review with the

418
00:25:30,058 --> 00:25:33,080
narration on in the game you dog barking
in the background

419
00:25:33,008 --> 00:25:36,083
or maybe for some more younger
developers in on shoot me cum

420
00:25:37,055 --> 00:25:41,174
there in a whole

421
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:46,120
no all lastly

422
00:25:46,012 --> 00:25:49,064
narration is a powerful tool the time
comes from the overuse you want to marry

423
00:25:49,064 --> 00:25:50,111
your entire video

424
00:25:51,011 --> 00:25:54,040
you wanna let your app speak so just use
narration

425
00:25:54,004 --> 00:25:57,040
wisely is what I'm gonna say and having
said that

426
00:25:57,076 --> 00:26:00,485
I wanna show you a really cool a preview

427
00:26:01,169 --> 00:26:04,470
as for a game Koleos fortune which i
think are

428
00:26:04,047 --> 00:26:08,072
gonna design or this week getting comes
from a UK FitFlop

429
00:26:08,072 --> 00:26:11,073
really cool

430
00:26:11,073 --> 00:26:14,077
so they have done something really neat
with their narration

431
00:26:14,077 --> 00:26:18,120
they have their character nary in the
intro to their game so the integrated

432
00:26:19,002 --> 00:26:20,031
that narration

433
00:26:20,049 --> 00:26:24,054
with some capture gameplay footage you
can get a picture above

434
00:26:24,054 --> 00:26:28,063
the story of the game as well as the
game play all in one

435
00:26:28,063 --> 00:26:33,127
wheels fortune preloader show Tia I used
to be really you pulled the gold

cool right

444
00:27:00,088 --> 00:27:07,088
I love that hours after you that I
thought I merely when by the game in

445
00:27:08,003 --> 00:27:11,098
you know now unlike level 12 or
something like that on okay

446
00:27:11,098 --> 00:27:15,142
so to give me a lot of information but
really there's no better way to get to

447
00:27:16,042 --> 00:27:17,120
know all this then to demonstrate it

448
00:27:18,002 --> 00:27:21,009
so what I'd like to demonstrate for sis

right there now's a good time just to
let you guys know

500
00:31:24,051 --> 00:31:27,126
up the QuickTime capture capture the
need a frame rate the your app

501
00:31:28,026 --> 00:31:31,090
outputs so when you're putting into
iTunes Connect we're gonna ask you to

502
00:31:31,009 --> 00:31:35,013
normalize that to standardize frame rate
so that one take video will still need

503
00:31:35,094 --> 00:31:36,166
to go through something like iMovie

504
00:31:37,066 --> 00:31:40,087
and be exported out to standardize frame
rate before it gets

505
00:31:40,087 --> 00:31:44,093
uploaded in Titan's connect right but
John we're going to a different one

506
00:31:45,047 --> 00:31:48,140
we're going to a maybe clip base yeah so
we've got a song we started in garage

507
00:31:49,004 --> 00:31:51,032
band already there be a good soundtrack
and then

508
00:31:51,068 --> 00:31:54,127
we could capture some instruments and
added them all together K

509
00:31:55,027 --> 00:31:58,045
from CSR a back up here and

510
00:31:58,045 --> 00:32:01,054
checker and birds all good make sure

511
00:32:01,054 --> 00:32:04,089
not to mention his performance record he
set a maximum member we want to deliver

512
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,133
the highest-quality

513
00:32:06,033 --> 00:32:09,114
video and audio to customers alright so
you're also you probably a smart you

514
00:32:10,014 --> 00:32:10,108
wanna play that song

515
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:18,008
yeah just a lil sample here so we can
hear snappy number

516
00:32:21,046 --> 00:32:25,075
sounds good through alright so what
we're gonna do is capture the

517
00:32:25,075 --> 00:32:28,096
the the clips the instruments made

518
00:32:28,096 --> 00:32:31,134

first answer we're going to we're going

519
00:32:32,034 --> 00:32:33,048
to send space

520

558
00:35:12,052 --> 00:35:15,103
let's show you how really easy it is to
drag those clips and

look at that current

562
00:35:27,064 --> 00:35:32,125
we're gonna grab those clips that we
just image are a drag mentor event

563
00:35:33,025 --> 00:35:37,086
we ever about right here this is where
we can browse our clips we can favorite

564
00:35:37,086 --> 00:35:37,092
them

565
00:35:38,046 --> 00:35:41,088
can work with them and we have our time
line down here we can start

566
00:35:41,088 --> 00:35:45,177
building our preview can I add titles in
transition so let's just start with some

567
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:49,116
drums is our drums we captured offstage
the real hard to capture in this room

568
00:35:50,016 --> 00:35:50,088
with the echo

569
00:35:50,088 --> 00:35:56,177
drag those here make the time while
smaller second worker

570

was the next instrument that was the
beaks

571
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:05,131
describing along here you can see on the
way for view operate here

572
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:10,089
think I see where my audio click San
again

573
00:36:10,089 --> 00:36:14,135
Rico

574
00:36:15,035 --> 00:36:21,047
to get them out base right thing

575
00:36:21,047 --> 00:36:25,050
and was an act that was the sent right
with the cool controllers

576
00:36:25,077 --> 00:36:28,091
skip

577
00:36:28,091 --> 00:36:31,172

583
00:36:59,077 --> 00:37:02,113
John song earlier put on the folder to
serve in a drag

584
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:06,034
that down into the soundtrack section

585
00:37:06,034 --> 00:37:11,095
rate there now I could add maybe some
titles to this

586
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:15,178
from the content library but I really do
like to end on a fade to black in any

587
00:37:16,078 --> 00:37:16,160
video that I do

588
00:37:17,006 --> 00:37:21,018
let's just track that on there that
literally pro

589
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:25,136
when I wanna do also

596
00:38:05,059 --> 00:38:05,530

let's check it out him

615
00:39:48,779 --> 00:39:53,803
her I it's let's open up iTunes Connect

616
00:39:54,019 --> 00:39:59,720
and here we are nineteen connect

617
00:39:59,072 --> 00:40:03,146
has if creating a new version of garage
bands as you can see

618
00:40:04,046 --> 00:40:07,945
there's currently only one im one
screenshot so

619
00:40:08,359 --> 00:40:11,373
let's add to its this is where we had

620
00:40:11,499 --> 00:40:15,700
new screenshots and the app review the
pollen John just Crean

621
00:40:15,007 --> 00:40:20,008
we could add them the old fashion way in
with the file chooser

622
00:40:20,071 --> 00:40:23,120
but it would be more fun to open up
finder

623
00:40:24,002 --> 00:40:28,621
and simply

624
00:40:28,819 --> 00:40:35,819
drag-and-drop from

625
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:43,809
had has you can see the video ends up in
first position

626
00:40:45,045 --> 00:40:50,142
followed by the screenshots to its right
the screenshots can be rearranged into

627
00:40:51,042 --> 00:40:53,681
whatever order you want by dragging and
dropping

628
00:40:54,059 --> 00:40:58,086
whatever order you choose is the order
that ends up in the App Store

629
00:40:58,329 --> 00:41:02,230
hmm the video will always remain fixed

630
00:41:02,023 --> 00:41:06,030
in first position just as it does in the
App Store cell

631
00:41:06,093 --> 00:41:11,095
this is all looking really good but I
don't love the poster frame on the app

632
00:41:11,095 --> 00:41:11,170
review

633
00:41:12,007 --> 00:41:16,076
by default we select a poster frame for
you

634
00:41:16,769 --> 00:41:21,720
by if you'd like to choose another one
just click Edit poster frame

635
00:41:21,072 --> 00:41:25,471
abut up pops a dialogue on with the
video are no

636
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:29,185
laps and the currently selected poster
frame on the right

637
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:33,836
to select another poster frame we can
play the video

638
00:41:34,349 --> 00:41:41,349
and pick or we can scrape through the
video

639
00:41:45,099 --> 00:41:52,099
right for him anytime

640
00:41:53,089 --> 00:41:57,140
or we can get granular and step through

641
00:41:57,014 --> 00:42:00,067
forward or backward

642
00:42:00,067 --> 00:42:04,246
to look it's just the right for him

643
00:42:04,849 --> 00:42:07,940
I like that one lets choose that one

644
00:42:07,094 --> 00:42:10,193
and once you've found the perfect frame

645
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:14,040
just click Done and voila

646
00:42:14,049 --> 00:42:17,052
there it is once

647
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:24,079
once you have your screen shots in your
poster for am looking just the way you

648
00:42:26,809 --> 00:42:27,480
want

649
00:42:27,048 --> 00:42:30,140
you can click same and submit for review

650
00:42:31,004 --> 00:42:34,843
and once

651
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:39,266
the app is gone through the approval
process we can check out what it looks

652
00:42:39,509 --> 00:42:41,150
like in the App Store

653
00:42:41,015 --> 00:42:45,124
