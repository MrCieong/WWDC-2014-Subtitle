1
00:00:13,038 --> 00:00:17,357
I

2
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:20,240
good afternoon thank you are welcome to

3
00:00:20,024 --> 00:00:23,099
what they tell me a session for 16
modern frameworks

4
00:00:23,099 --> 00:00:26,156
to me. talking a lot about mostly I'm

5
00:00:27,056 --> 00:00:30,107
the mechanics setting up modern
frameworks on IRS

6
00:00:31,007 --> 00:00:34,069
some the API design principles that we
use it up on

7
00:00:34,069 --> 00:00:38,093
and we recommend you guys use if you
were here for and Ian Collins talk

8
00:00:38,093 --> 00:00:42,042
just before this I they really delved
into a lot of the

9
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,010
deep architectural components

10
00:00:46,001 --> 00:00:50,057
apart build your application me to cover
some the higher level stuff and then

11
00:00:50,057 --> 00:00:51,796
we'll go through a quick tour of Xcode

12
00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:56,333
and talk about how some of these things
get built directly into your apt and

13
00:00:56,549 --> 00:00:59,680
just a mechanic to getting all about
setup

14
00:00:59,068 --> 00:01:03,517
so I'm how many of you have actually
used

15
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:07,171
I am static libraries in your
application you get from a third party

16
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:12,470
that everyone okay if you're doing it
without one of those things you're

17
00:01:12,047 --> 00:01:14,131
probably using the target management
mechanisms in Xcode

18
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:18,092
right you download a bunch of source
code files you put them someplace on

19
00:01:18,092 --> 00:01:18,153
your drive

20
00:01:19,053 --> 00:01:23,432
you hope you remember where you left
them I

21
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:27,090
and you're messing around with this near
shifting things in our targets

22
00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:30,093
you maybe even taking them wholesale
dumping directly in your applications

23
00:01:30,093 --> 00:01:30,822
when I've got

24
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:35,050
six or seven copies across all the
applications are working on

25
00:01:35,005 --> 00:01:39,614
things like that I the next step up from
this is

26
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:42,690
the static library right the coca
touched attic library

27
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:47,145
2.0 a you start to put it someplace
you're probably checking in your sources

28
00:01:48,045 --> 00:01:52,067
I the died a separate header seen you
put a header someplace

29
00:01:52,067 --> 00:01:56,152
you can't carry assets along with it so
you don't get to do things like

30
00:01:57,052 --> 00:02:00,077
have a bunch a nice pictures or
customized

31
00:02:00,077 --> 00:02:03,114
controls and things like that in your
application so

32
00:02:04,014 --> 00:02:07,019
this is good but not great

33
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:12,818
and I was a so actually me back up for
second or ten dollar purse

34
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:16,890
you guys are here all six review now
okay

35
00:02:16,089 --> 00:02:20,089
I am how many you've actually ship the
framework

36
00:02:20,089 --> 00:02:23,218
while okay

37
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:27,640
a good number great I O S users you can
do it now too

38
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:33,993
there are some restrictions that so
we'll talk about that

39
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:37,860
one of the reasons that you're going to
use frameworks is

40
00:02:37,086 --> 00:02:40,114
to be able to package absolutely
everything up that you need is a single

41
00:02:41,014 --> 00:02:44,017
unit writers can include headers
conclude

42
00:02:44,044 --> 00:02:48,313
images asa catalogs you name it throw in
the free market goes along as a single

43
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:48,748
unit

44
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:52,610
you'll be able to put this framework
someplace on your drive cue track I'm

45
00:02:52,061 --> 00:02:55,077
Xcode will take a removing those things
in the right place in your application

46
00:02:55,077 --> 00:02:58,163
bill writer lot a really neat features a
built-in for Iowa State

47
00:02:59,063 --> 00:03:02,106
especially the faces from the new
features to be able to make

48
00:03:03,006 --> 00:03:06,104
the workflow for frameworks really a
factor for Euro essay taps

49
00:03:07,004 --> 00:03:11,045
but why do you want to use remarks well

50
00:03:11,045 --> 00:03:16,724
all the packaging stuff is really nice
but all the features that are now I say

51
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:18,151
take advantage

52
00:03:18,349 --> 00:03:22,190
are frameworks so the first thing you
prolly wanna try using is live you

53
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:24,031
should live rendering views and
Interface Builder

54
00:03:24,031 --> 00:03:27,056
so you're putting things into framework

55
00:03:27,056 --> 00:03:30,125
all the custom rendering on a custom
drawn becomes available Interface

56
00:03:31,025 --> 00:03:32,028
Builder for use

57
00:03:32,028 --> 00:03:36,067
directly next code as your editing unit
your storyboard

58
00:03:36,067 --> 00:03:39,075
I guess I chose my age were also reports
now right

59
00:03:40,047 --> 00:03:45,062
not kids anymore I if you're using
extensions

60
00:03:45,062 --> 00:03:48,151
right you're gonna want to use framers
because you can be able to share code

61
00:03:49,051 --> 00:03:50,075
between extension

62
00:03:50,075 --> 00:03:53,084
and the application without having to
duplicate stuff in each place

63
00:03:53,084 --> 00:03:56,136
way to you won't be putting things in
the in the target the extension the

64
00:03:57,036 --> 00:04:00,195
target for a friend to the free app you
put in the framework and link the two

65
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:03,940
against the framework itself I

66
00:04:03,094 --> 00:04:06,129
if you write multiple applications

67
00:04:07,029 --> 00:04:09,115
and you're using either a third party
framework you're getting from someplace

68
00:04:10,015 --> 00:04:13,081
else are you have a bunch of your own
tried-and-true tested code that you like

69
00:04:13,081 --> 00:04:13,144
all your

70
00:04:14,044 --> 00:04:17,048
categories on a string because I you
know who does that but

71
00:04:17,084 --> 00:04:20,323
okay categories in a string and things
like that for sharing code between

72
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,440
multiple applications

73
00:04:22,044 --> 00:04:25,113
you're gonna want to use frameworks and
obviously also if you're going to be

74
00:04:25,509 --> 00:04:28,580
publishing a free market remaking all
over your code available

75
00:04:28,058 --> 00:04:31,119
as a framework you want to get a package
that up

76
00:04:32,019 --> 00:04:35,468
in a single distributable thing that
everybody can download music and

77
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:35,720
versions

78
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:39,630
so let's talk a little bit about getting
set up

79
00:04:39,063 --> 00:04:42,105
Xcode makes it really easy to create

80
00:04:43,005 --> 00:04:46,874
a new framework the new template right
insider the

81
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,975
a new file dialog where the project I
logged it says

82
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,830
Cocoa Touch framework right you can just
a click on that

83
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:56,130
we're gonna go to try markets can walk
you through the same form get a bundle

84
00:04:57,003 --> 00:04:57,060
ID

85
00:04:57,087 --> 00:05:00,099
things like that David someplace you're
off to the races

86
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:03,132
this also works if you have an existing
project you create new target one the

87
00:05:04,032 --> 00:05:05,037
new target template is

88
00:05:05,082 --> 00:05:08,179
a Cocoa Touch friend I

89
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:14,238
what was it once you decide you can use
frameworks

90
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:17,955
when you put your

91
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:22,270
if you're using live use if you're
interested in a framework for live use

92
00:05:22,027 --> 00:05:23,093
your gonna wanna put

93
00:05:23,093 --> 00:05:26,159
the views in there and controls and
anything else that goes along with

94
00:05:27,059 --> 00:05:29,124
giving your out that custom apparent

95
00:05:30,024 --> 00:05:33,109
right to review all the assets
interviews will be offered wrong code

96
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:37,075
the control so again if the assets
things like that they all go in the

97
00:05:37,075 --> 00:05:38,274
frame

98
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:42,180
that way now when you make it for for
using with your application

99
00:05:42,018 --> 00:05:45,059
or giving out to all your friends
neighbors and

100
00:05:45,059 --> 00:05:49,138
trying to use it within exco try be all
its up two starts to work

101
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:54,105
right what goes in if you're using
extensions

102
00:05:55,005 --> 00:05:58,043
where to put all the same stuff you
would put in for live use the views in

103
00:05:58,043 --> 00:06:02,592
the controls because my parents because
your extension probably has all about

104
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:07,240
you're also going to put in things like
you control a class

105
00:06:07,024 --> 00:06:10,026
write a custom view controllers at your
writing you wanna make available its API

106
00:06:10,044 --> 00:06:11,121
to everyone else or to your

107
00:06:12,021 --> 00:06:16,047
expansion into your application those
are gonna go in there as well

108
00:06:16,047 --> 00:06:19,061
you're probably also gonna put the
service API to using down there so if

109
00:06:19,061 --> 00:06:21,066
you doing that working code things like
that

110
00:06:21,066 --> 00:06:24,445
all that's what's gonna go down
resources

111
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,039
again assets I'm

112
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:31,360
configuration files to my peeps
particular to your service

113
00:06:31,036 --> 00:06:34,185
go down there anything that goes in
common

114
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:37,850
two-year extension your application so

115
00:06:37,085 --> 00:06:40,099
that's also true if you're going to be
sure using primer contents between

116
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:42,338
multiple applications

117
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:46,150
right you got two or three application
from the store users are going ahead and

118
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:49,068
download iOS applications from the store

119
00:06:49,068 --> 00:06:52,127
you're gonna wanna put all the stuff in
common right the idea here is your ideal

120
00:06:53,027 --> 00:06:56,027
change the source code once building new
version of your framework

121
00:06:56,027 --> 00:06:59,266
make it available call your applications
on your machine so that when you ship

122
00:06:59,509 --> 00:06:59,600
marxist or

123
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:03,500
all those changes get picked up and

124
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:06,066
when you're publishing framers again
it's the same thing

125
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:11,160
so really what you gonna wind up doing
is

126
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:14,990
refractor your application using along
the architectural things that any in

127
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:15,147
column were talking about

128
00:07:16,047 --> 00:07:20,119
in the previous our point goes into 8 an
organizational unit

129
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:24,115
like the framework in order to make your
development a lot easier

130
00:07:25,015 --> 00:07:28,434
I'm

131
00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:32,030
the app right now if you're using
extensions for instance

132
00:07:32,003 --> 00:07:35,362
got an application its gonna have to
part can have

133
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:39,340
the app and the extension that nifty
little

134
00:07:39,034 --> 00:07:42,040
building brick there is the extension
writer

135
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:45,017
they sit next to each other inside the
application bundle you can think the

136
00:07:45,053 --> 00:07:47,062
extension as basically a little tiny
application

137
00:07:48,043 --> 00:07:51,112
for got a buncha source code in there

138
00:07:52,012 --> 00:07:56,841
and it probably share some source code
from swift files may be subject to see

139
00:07:56,949 --> 00:07:58,160
files

140
00:07:58,016 --> 00:08:01,041
those things are all gonna be a party
the targets

141
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:04,116
right rather than have the object code
generated by those who think those

142
00:08:05,016 --> 00:08:05,072
things getting

143
00:08:05,072 --> 00:08:08,115
duplicated into each of those targets

144
00:08:09,015 --> 00:08:12,091
what you do is just pull the common
stock down into the framework

145
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:18,630
and lengthy application extension
against the framework

146
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:22,477
how do you decide workers down there as
far as code goes

147
00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:25,620
if it looks like it's showing up more
than once in a target or more than once

148
00:08:25,062 --> 00:08:26,761
your application

149
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:30,460
probably cousin framework I'm

150
00:08:30,046 --> 00:08:34,047
we do this at Apple we look across all
the applications that were developing

151
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:37,315
we start seeing patterns you start
seeing things they're ripping themselves

152
00:08:37,819 --> 00:08:40,854
we take those patterns are pulling down
in the framework either go from

153
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:44,910
the action you I can't really go to me
absolutely at Kitano H 10

154
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:47,174
we go down and foundation the wind up
going down the core OS there are a lot

155
00:08:48,074 --> 00:08:49,105
of different places

156
00:08:50,005 --> 00:08:54,394
where we start pulling common code
autographed and make sure they wind up

157
00:08:54,439 --> 00:08:57,443
at the right level out abstraction for
use everywhere else

158
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,850
i'd so a really good technique in terms
of separating out everything you're

159
00:09:02,085 --> 00:09:04,091
doing in your applications is

160
00:09:04,091 --> 00:09:07,186
doing the same thing figure out what's
in common put it in the framework

161
00:09:08,086 --> 00:09:11,725
use the framework is the unit
distribution for pulling a lot stuff

162
00:09:12,499 --> 00:09:13,586
together

163
00:09:14,369 --> 00:09:18,407
premature API you heard and in Karnataka
little bit about it

164
00:09:18,749 --> 00:09:21,756
a yes I'm yesterday earlier today

165
00:09:22,449 --> 00:09:26,457
I identifying the responsibilities
figuring out who should be doing what

166
00:09:27,249 --> 00:09:28,295
within your classes

167
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:32,610
right some guy in the internet wrote a
thing about being rufus with your object

168
00:09:32,061 --> 00:09:34,136
to make sure there is clean bright lines
between

169
00:09:35,036 --> 00:09:38,072
where those responsibilities go

170
00:09:38,072 --> 00:09:41,601
is a great technique and will make a lot
to develop an easier

171
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:45,314
to take the same kinds a framework
approach to

172
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:48,928
developing your application because now
you get really separable code could

173
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:50,670
easily testable code

174
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:53,276
you get very very good abstraction
layers

175
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:57,110
once you decide they're gonna be
offering frameworks to your application

176
00:09:57,011 --> 00:10:00,960
or anyone else for the publisher
framework is API for your service

177
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:04,143
you know providing all those you argue
controllers to go along with it

178
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:09,917
the key word there is its API the key
thing is to make sure that you get

179
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:14,085
papi right we spend

180
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:18,730
weeks arguing about things I mailing
lists Apple about how to develop the API

181
00:10:19,189 --> 00:10:22,250
with the architecture should look like
what things should be named

182
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:26,790
all that stuff there are some cocoa go
our guidelines that we use

183
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,968
I'm gonna run through some of them here
one of them is that it's much better

184
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:33,700
to be clear than it is to be brief

185
00:10:33,889 --> 00:10:36,987
right so a method like this in
objective-c insert at

186
00:10:37,869 --> 00:10:41,931
three Bree very terse

187
00:10:42,489 --> 00:10:45,505
when you insert when

188
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:48,661
at you're inserting it to

189
00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:52,920
don't do this it's not clear enough it's
not specific enough

190
00:10:52,092 --> 00:10:56,791
it doesn't help you because you know we
all write this code what once twice

191
00:10:57,619 --> 00:11:01,619
gonna read thousands of times I'm gonna
hand a whole bunch of code of to some

192
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:05,626
kid was younger and smarter than I am
he's got to figure out what I was doing

193
00:11:05,689 --> 00:11:09,220
right so be clear expressed your intent

194
00:11:09,022 --> 00:11:12,066
Insert Object at index

195
00:11:12,066 --> 00:11:15,066
right what you inserting some object
where's it going

196
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:18,355
at an index right now you got a very
specific for

197
00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:22,952
guarantee you gotta readable readable
chunk of code

198
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:26,258
this is the kind of thing that we will
literally spend

199
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:31,110
a week an email arguing about to get
right

200
00:11:31,011 --> 00:11:34,035
API design is a contact sport at our
company

201
00:11:34,035 --> 00:11:37,041
so if you're not if you're not really
throwing some elbows in the mailing list

202
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:37,098
with your

203
00:11:37,098 --> 00:11:40,617
with your friends and neighbors in in a
in during a TI you're probably just not

204
00:11:41,499 --> 00:11:42,518
having enough fun with it

205
00:11:42,689 --> 00:11:45,764
so I'm so do this

206
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:50,360
be really specific don't abbreviate

207
00:11:50,036 --> 00:11:53,044
right don't make your selectors look
like line noise

208
00:11:54,016 --> 00:11:59,425
except occurred color we have code
completion it fills out for you can get

209
00:11:59,569 --> 00:12:00,651
a couple keystrokes and do it it'll tell
you

210
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:06,465
0 work you know set background color

211
00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:11,218
right long tells you exactly what's
going on

212
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,845
do that a

213
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:17,974
don't be ambiguous right there lotta
words that can be used

214
00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:22,724
differ for now on here's one the ones
that I actually proposed in managed to

215
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:24,160
get by

216
00:12:24,016 --> 00:12:28,029
now regret display name

217
00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:30,098
right you see this in a couple places I
think it's a nice File Manager these

218
00:12:30,098 --> 00:12:30,727
days

219
00:12:31,609 --> 00:12:34,663
we try not to do this anymore it display
a downer for

220
00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:38,195
might only thing to show the name to
somebody

221
00:12:38,609 --> 00:12:42,614
or is it a name intended for display

222
00:12:43,109 --> 00:12:46,220
right what we do these days in the

223
00:12:46,022 --> 00:12:49,117
in the kit mostly is anything that
intended for the display to the user is

224
00:12:50,017 --> 00:12:50,085
is

225
00:12:50,085 --> 00:12:53,594
a localized name even if you're getting
is input from the user because you're

226
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:54,451
going from input

227
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,287
as input from the user it's pretty much
is localized as its gonna get

228
00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:03,100
right coming from that if you're showing
it to the user

229
00:13:03,001 --> 00:13:05,720
and it on your strengths while some
things like that it's the localized name

230
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:06,824
is coming out of

231
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,869
the bundle system to have the right
localization

232
00:13:09,869 --> 00:13:12,916
right or intent was to be able to say
you wanna show you something in their

233
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:14,411
language

234
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:19,600
it's for display and everybody went well
why I'm calling

235
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:23,715
explaining why isn't a strong group your
let's not do that

236
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:28,309
so be clear

237
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:32,340
also don't take advantage or some other
things that

238
00:13:32,619 --> 00:13:36,632
objective-c in this case what you do for
instance you could declare send action

239
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:37,827
like this

240
00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:41,625
and you don't necessarily have to give
names to the parameters

241
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:45,515
so this produces a call so I

242
00:13:45,749 --> 00:13:48,820
that looks like send action callin
callin in fed action object Cohen

243
00:13:49,459 --> 00:13:52,491
but production selector colon object
Colin plaque it's not

244
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:58,220
specific enough what the object intended
to be what is that flag action me

245
00:13:58,022 --> 00:14:01,091
right fill the hole selector out

246
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:05,330
send action to object for all cells yes
or no

247
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:09,165
butterfly could but I think about
animated it could have been

248
00:14:09,309 --> 00:14:13,342
you know stop transmitting the method
message after you find a hit or keep

249
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:14,662
going

250
00:14:14,869 --> 00:14:18,940
those kinds of things have to be spelled
out again you're going right at once

251
00:14:19,579 --> 00:14:22,660
somebody's gonna come by later and curse
your name because they have to read it

252
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:27,461
a thousand times after that don't be
that guy

253
00:14:28,109 --> 00:14:34,140
do this on swift no brings us some
really interesting opportunities to be

254
00:14:34,419 --> 00:14:38,446
clear to be expressive and still try to
maintain some in the church miss in the

255
00:14:38,689 --> 00:14:41,220
West typing in things like that we'd
like to do

256
00:14:41,022 --> 00:14:44,701
and something to talk about as far as
what goes I'm

257
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:47,980
our little bit different because for us

258
00:14:47,098 --> 00:14:50,127
we're still trying to figure out what
some the the really good API

259
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:55,046
idioms mean and we're really not sure
what it means to have a language in EM

260
00:14:55,379 --> 00:15:00,393
for language it has had about 200 native
speakers for less than a year

261
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:04,584
so trying to figure out what some of the
stuff is going to wind up looking like

262
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:07,260
a little bit of a challenge is actually
great opportunity for all you to be able

263
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,080
to provide us feedback which swept

264
00:15:10,179 --> 00:15:14,264
in terms of what the ATI looks like and
how your experiences in using it both

265
00:15:15,029 --> 00:15:18,066
as a native language into the mix and
match pits

266
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,420
a with cocoa and Cocoa Touch and let us
know

267
00:15:21,609 --> 00:15:24,678
exactly what you'd like to see in and
what makes it easy to use with with all

268
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,324
these things worse is what makes you
feel like there's a there's a little bit

269
00:15:27,549 --> 00:15:28,595
for chin

270
00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:33,034
right so please make sure your filing as
Raiders on how you like it to work

271
00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:36,311
I'm fickle a quick look at it and that's
what function are

272
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:39,865
I pull this out over the example to in
the book but I'm gonna serve work

273
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,671
through those animal extend it to

274
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,044
to something else so contains character
string character so

275
00:15:46,809 --> 00:15:50,814
a swift function has named parameters

276
00:15:50,859 --> 00:15:55,850
in this case these names are the are the
very willing to use inside the function

277
00:15:55,085 --> 00:15:58,534
to describe the variables

278
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:02,312
rights which produces a call so it looks
like this compares character body

279
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:05,436
you writers a string there's a a
character

280
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:09,135
if you tackle hash mark in front of it

281
00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:12,204
this is not a social media construct you
don't get to find out what's trending in

282
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:14,426
your code

283
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:18,246
although it might be an interesting
question how often he use hash tag

284
00:16:18,579 --> 00:16:19,622
character

285
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:23,034
I'm this allows you to be able to

286
00:16:23,259 --> 00:16:27,850
use unnamed parameter at the call so I
can be specific about what is this

287
00:16:27,085 --> 00:16:30,434
produces a call so it looks like this
contains character string

288
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,247
character right Java code

289
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:39,410
you got method overloading you can wind
up with a method

290
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:44,060
thats one word and it has 19 different
set the parameters some have

291
00:16:44,006 --> 00:16:48,075
you know for arguments 6 arguments 12
arguments 9 argument summer the same

292
00:16:48,669 --> 00:16:50,671
summer different

293
00:16:50,869 --> 00:16:52,955
what arguments are they his name
parameters are great way to be able to

294
00:16:53,729 --> 00:16:54,823
actually tell it the call sites

295
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:58,742
which ones you're using a long way to
way to be expressed in a two way to be

296
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:00,405
specific

297
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:05,094
right one other really nifty things
about swept

298
00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:08,949
is the mix and match feature being able
to take code

299
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:13,400
that already exist you've already got a
$200 check to see Co

300
00:17:13,004 --> 00:17:15,813
interparticle terms and shipping
applications and things like that would

301
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:20,010
be not to throw that away and try to do
it all over again swept

302
00:17:20,001 --> 00:17:24,150
be fun if you have the time you probably
don't you're trying to ship

303
00:17:24,159 --> 00:17:28,950
right mix and match what you do things
like this this is

304
00:17:28,095 --> 00:17:32,444
the popular presentation API from you I
kept

305
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:37,690
it gets converted into something that
were too big we like this

306
00:17:37,069 --> 00:17:41,308
by the mix and match system for swept

307
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:45,600
I so function present pop over from
wrecked

308
00:17:45,006 --> 00:17:50,435
wrecked view our directions animated
that produces the Call site that works

309
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:54,031
like this okay

310
00:17:54,049 --> 00:17:58,080
again not specific enough not a really
good

311
00:17:58,008 --> 00:18:01,019
description of what's happening right
what any their

312
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:05,046
I have no idea what is true me I'm some
reckon some you are at least descriptive

313
00:18:05,046 --> 00:18:05,107
enough

314
00:18:06,007 --> 00:18:10,496
but it doesn't really help me out those
aren't my variable right

315
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,584
if we read a clear oh and then we've got
present from bar but night I mean that

316
00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:15,809
just throws the other wrench into it

317
00:18:15,809 --> 00:18:20,220
right which is okay well I apart on item
but are directions animator still there

318
00:18:20,022 --> 00:18:23,091
we can be more specific about these
things

319
00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:26,320
we can take advantage a function
overloading method overloading and say

320
00:18:26,032 --> 00:18:30,038
call both present pop over what the heck
right now we've got this really neat way

321
00:18:30,038 --> 00:18:31,125
to be able to separate out

322
00:18:32,025 --> 00:18:35,037
the other API from I

323
00:18:35,037 --> 00:18:38,196
you know Coco and Cocoa Touch

324
00:18:38,529 --> 00:18:42,960
and make me too different so we had a
rough cut

325
00:18:42,096 --> 00:18:46,025
from rec to rec writer from rick is
gonna wind up being

326
00:18:46,889 --> 00:18:52,830
external name to use at the call so I
records can be variable inside the mat

327
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:55,135
the implementation variable you're using
for parameter it's the name to use for

328
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:56,086
cramming

329
00:18:56,086 --> 00:19:00,535
pastor in Huehuetenango hash marks there
again

330
00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:06,317
that makes you that makes it possible to
use the same name as the externally miss

331
00:19:06,389 --> 00:19:09,970
the internal main news produce call
sites that look like this

332
00:19:09,097 --> 00:19:12,132
rights not to present pop over from
recon view our directions animated in

333
00:19:13,032 --> 00:19:15,044
prison pop over from bar button item

334
00:19:15,044 --> 00:19:18,613
her directions animate Creek I can tell
the difference between that

335
00:19:19,009 --> 00:19:22,370
awesome

336
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:25,088
while typing completions nice but

337
00:19:25,088 --> 00:19:29,147
experts stole a buncha typing Swift has
some really nice features

338
00:19:30,047 --> 00:19:33,122
for default arguments your API

339
00:19:34,022 --> 00:19:38,461
so let's go back and take a look at just
the present popover method

340
00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:43,380
okay if we read a clear like this

341
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:46,061
what we've got is you're probably right
direction is the type and

342
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:49,125
dot any there is the default value

343
00:19:50,025 --> 00:19:54,033
rights with when it goes through the mix
and match bit takes the common prefix

344
00:19:54,033 --> 00:19:57,095
offer the norms for the options and
makes them

345
00:19:57,095 --> 00:20:00,108
the shortened version at the end which
is one really nice thing about when we

346
00:20:01,008 --> 00:20:04,107
went back to ruin and started
normalizing all the names again a pretty

347
00:20:04,179 --> 00:20:05,277
common prefixes allowed us to do this

348
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:11,840
so dot any as passed into a popover air
direction tight is

349
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:14,097
that particular entry out of the NFC
numb

350
00:20:14,097 --> 00:20:18,146
are argument and bought get through
there is a a way to say that yes

351
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:22,080
if there's no argument presented you
want to be able to have this thing

352
00:20:22,629 --> 00:20:26,632
be true all the time so that turns these
call sites

353
00:20:26,929 --> 00:20:31,003
which are nice for descriptive

354
00:20:31,669 --> 00:20:34,695
into these call sites

355
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:38,090
right won the patterns were you seen
foundation I'm

356
00:20:38,009 --> 00:20:41,348
is you'll see a really long method it'll
have probably an hour

357
00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:44,690
anywhere between six and a 212 argument

358
00:20:44,069 --> 00:20:47,132
I think you'll see versions are that are
shorter your general you'll see the

359
00:20:48,032 --> 00:20:51,771
and arguments have an object to seize
order starting appeal walk go shorter

360
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:55,061
versions are calling in the longer
version with the default values

361
00:20:55,259 --> 00:20:59,250
writers are all generally one-line
implementations a call back out to

362
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:02,071
the big guy with all the switches on it
right

363
00:21:02,071 --> 00:21:05,160
this is where you can provide all those
switches without having to provide all

364
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:06,862
those methods all the time

365
00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:10,500
put in the same default values

366
00:21:10,005 --> 00:21:12,092
this provide you with some really good
opportunities to be able to clean up

367
00:21:13,037 --> 00:21:13,716
your code

368
00:21:14,049 --> 00:21:18,133
be really clear in swift and doing this
in swift talking

369
00:21:18,889 --> 00:21:22,450
to objective-c API's you can store
really

370
00:21:22,045 --> 00:21:26,394
sending down the API surface so you
don't have tons and tons and tons

371
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,886
methods to keep track of you got one
place to these implementations

372
00:21:30,669 --> 00:21:34,740
the default value should go in the right
place

373
00:21:34,074 --> 00:21:38,075
was really good documentation online the
coding guidelines for Coco developer

374
00:21:38,075 --> 00:21:39,100
Apple dot com

375
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,169
I just go to to developer Apple com

376
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:46,193
login search for this document

377
00:21:46,409 --> 00:21:50,200
it's the same coding guidelines that we
have up on our internal wiki

378
00:21:50,002 --> 00:21:55,081
for how to get started with developing
API right so the rules that work trying

379
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:56,610
to put down there

380
00:21:56,061 --> 00:21:59,510
do the same things that we use that
Apple so another good reason to go in

381
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:03,100
and and look at these is

382
00:22:03,001 --> 00:22:06,460
all the check to see if your gonna write
if you're

383
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,370
not just can't talk it over and go for
swept entirely a hump

384
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:13,100
all the API will work well in be fit in
with

385
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,025
the idioms we already have for are
existing cocoa frameworks

386
00:22:18,025 --> 00:22:22,031
the other docking a primary don't
revolve download it already

387
00:22:22,085 --> 00:22:24,634
this with programming language I
wouldn't be surprised if all you

388
00:22:25,399 --> 00:22:28,414
suddenly have more experience with an
idea by this point

389
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:31,612
I'm drilled on I but it also available
online

390
00:22:32,179 --> 00:22:36,251
developer Apple com it's got all ok the
information about swift in it and they

391
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:38,080
do make some API

392
00:22:38,008 --> 00:22:41,020
recommendations in there as well again

393
00:22:41,002 --> 00:22:44,081
we're all sort of just figuring this out

394
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:48,280
so if there's something that you see
that makes a lot of sense

395
00:22:48,379 --> 00:22:51,406
great call it out tell us because we'll
make sure we try to keep it

396
00:22:51,649 --> 00:22:54,350
if there's something you see that you
don't like or that you like to make

397
00:22:54,035 --> 00:22:55,073
suggestions are

398
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:59,772
sentiment I'm take advantage a bug
report outlook.com get the radars in on

399
00:23:00,429 --> 00:23:03,435
swift because this is really your
opportunity to have a lot of influence

400
00:23:04,029 --> 00:23:08,117
on how all the stuff develops if you're
publishing a framework

401
00:23:08,909 --> 00:23:13,320
whether it's for your own applications
or whether through application for other

402
00:23:13,032 --> 00:23:15,981
people to use in their own applications

403
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:20,190
you gonna run into a problem this is a
problem that we run into every time you

404
00:23:20,019 --> 00:23:22,128
release a new version the operating
system and that's

405
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:25,580
framework version right

406
00:23:25,058 --> 00:23:28,857
to user has gone down a whole bunch
about

407
00:23:29,379 --> 00:23:33,240
darn well and good for you guys

408
00:23:33,024 --> 00:23:37,323
issued on what all your abs but I all
those applications

409
00:23:37,539 --> 00:23:41,590
what's a used the latest version of this
new framework that just came out

410
00:23:42,049 --> 00:23:46,072
and Virgin 1 so for a while at least

411
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:49,960
you're in good shape everybody's got the
same code running if an application

412
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:53,112
sends information to another one be an
extension or via the open URL calling

413
00:23:54,012 --> 00:23:55,171
things like that

414
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:59,314
hey all the object work together

415
00:23:59,629 --> 00:24:03,690
no problem right awesome

416
00:24:03,069 --> 00:24:08,084
and then you come out the new version
the framework

417
00:24:08,084 --> 00:24:12,513
and some applications update to in some
applications don't

418
00:24:13,269 --> 00:24:17,269
or some the applications just got
developed in an abandoned unknown never

419
00:24:17,269 --> 00:24:18,358
update

420
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:22,610
right for some applications on the
user's device are going to be version 2

421
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:26,160
blue ones some versions or conversion
what

422
00:24:27,006 --> 00:24:30,015
and now suddenly I'm trying to send an
object to that other application from

423
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:33,086
aversion to frame it to a version one
free marker from a version 1 framework

424
00:24:33,086 --> 00:24:35,109
to aversion to framework

425
00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:40,338
not everything's the same was object
grow new capabilities the dated you're

426
00:24:40,419 --> 00:24:41,466
passing back and forth may have

427
00:24:41,889 --> 00:24:45,966
new keys in right 1i think you're gonna
have to do if you are going to be

428
00:24:46,659 --> 00:24:47,870
publishing a framework

429
00:24:47,087 --> 00:24:50,146
is be very careful about the versioning

430
00:24:50,929 --> 00:24:54,028
so a number of things that you can do
you

431
00:24:54,919 --> 00:24:57,953
but dealing with framework versions
first

432
00:24:58,259 --> 00:25:01,700
you're gonna have to put a framework
version in there anyway

433
00:25:01,007 --> 00:25:05,106
the the framework mechanism in creating
target when you create a new

434
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:09,580
project for framework because the
entropy list for the short version

435
00:25:09,058 --> 00:25:10,070
string cue track at

436
00:25:10,007 --> 00:25:13,007
use that that information you can use in
order to figure out

437
00:25:13,007 --> 00:25:16,346
what's happening what version free
mckree went against what version

438
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,050
is the data coming from you can send
that data to something else to see him a

439
00:25:20,149 --> 00:25:23,165
version one thing a reversion to print

440
00:25:23,309 --> 00:25:26,382
the other thing you should do probably
should take advantage acute archiving or

441
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:32,066
key archiving like behavior right so if
you are doing key-value stuff is as part

442
00:25:32,309 --> 00:25:33,190
of your archiving

443
00:25:33,019 --> 00:25:37,062
her partner document format make sure
that your key value pair meanings

444
00:25:37,062 --> 00:25:40,064
are consistent right don't suddenly for

445
00:25:40,082 --> 00:25:44,061
for version one key that might be
background-color: don't suddenly make

446
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,870
zero mean white instead of black
conversion to

447
00:25:47,509 --> 00:25:51,370
because then suddenly the developing
your the users to come along and you're

448
00:25:51,037 --> 00:25:53,120
gonna get sent from Sunday dinner gonna
say well this this completely run don't

449
00:25:54,002 --> 00:25:54,321
walk

450
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:59,531
what happen right so once you committed
to what a key/value pair means

451
00:25:59,639 --> 00:26:02,640
or what our relationship between two key
value pairs mean

452
00:26:02,649 --> 00:26:04,734
inside this archive you're sending back
and forth a different version to your

453
00:26:05,499 --> 00:26:06,526
cell

454
00:26:06,769 --> 00:26:10,840
you really kinda have to stick with
right we do this in apple also there's

455
00:26:10,084 --> 00:26:13,089
this whole set of keys that that have
that a ser come along to make sure that

456
00:26:14,034 --> 00:26:15,070
when we open up

457
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:18,083
archives from older versions in the
system that we can continue to read that

458
00:26:19,046 --> 00:26:20,051
data

459
00:26:20,096 --> 00:26:23,172
you do get lotsa interesting
opportunities at reading right time to

460
00:26:24,072 --> 00:26:25,771
be able to deal with that so

461
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:29,690
one is missing key should return or the
equivalent in the face is getting back

462
00:26:29,069 --> 00:26:29,628
nil

463
00:26:30,249 --> 00:26:34,312
you probably want to do something saying
right if you're looking for a key in its

464
00:26:34,879 --> 00:26:35,904
not there

465
00:26:36,129 --> 00:26:39,350
maybe it's a great opportunity for some
default value get injected in

466
00:26:39,035 --> 00:26:43,109
at the time the Huron archive and that's
really the opportunity able to do that

467
00:26:44,009 --> 00:26:46,228
because the the encoding and decoding

468
00:26:46,309 --> 00:26:50,366
are your chances to get that interface
when you're writing that data out

469
00:26:50,879 --> 00:26:54,120
you can be rented out for consumption by
somebody else when you're consuming that

470
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:54,083
data

471
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:58,132
you can have to look at it go well not
really sure where this comes from so I

472
00:26:58,879 --> 00:26:59,908
should at least be wary of

473
00:27:00,169 --> 00:27:05,191
right if you're encoding things in you
know that there's a bug back they really

474
00:27:05,389 --> 00:27:05,478
need to fix

475
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:08,376
back in version one you can do it by
encoding something different you might

476
00:27:09,249 --> 00:27:10,620
do that

477
00:27:10,062 --> 00:27:13,121
if you're looking at situations where
polling new keys in

478
00:27:14,021 --> 00:27:17,490
the old code isn't gonna go looking for
those new keys that can ignore those

479
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,680
things are probably pretty say

480
00:27:19,779 --> 00:27:22,779
the new stuff you wanna make sure you're
not

481
00:27:22,779 --> 00:27:26,330
stomping on all keys you not interfering
with the relationships between

482
00:27:26,033 --> 00:27:29,332
use when you encode and decode that your
interface

483
00:27:29,629 --> 00:27:32,706
I know I'm writing out for something's
gonna pick this up and I don't know what

484
00:27:33,399 --> 00:27:33,497
version it's going to be

485
00:27:34,379 --> 00:27:38,700
for I'm getting data back in I have no
idea where it came from

486
00:27:38,007 --> 00:27:41,476
right make sure your keys unique right

487
00:27:42,169 --> 00:27:44,267
is somebody subclassing your stuff and
they're sending stuff back and forth but

488
00:27:45,149 --> 00:27:46,190
they're depending on your framework

489
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,582
you don't want to actually stop on their
namespace

490
00:27:49,789 --> 00:27:53,090
right to keep the keys

491
00:27:53,009 --> 00:27:56,020
you know we're getting some some names
beating behavior in sweat the keys in

492
00:27:56,002 --> 00:27:56,961
these kinds of things

493
00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:01,173
aren't our art namespace it also make
sure the unique use the prefixes

494
00:28:01,299 --> 00:28:05,980
if you are really defensive use your
bundle ID prefix it there

495
00:28:05,098 --> 00:28:08,547
I'm won the ways you can also a

496
00:28:09,429 --> 00:28:12,464
mentions I didn't put in a sly one ways
you can also work with this is is by

497
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:14,940
conforming to en a secure coding

498
00:28:14,094 --> 00:28:18,653
right secure code to make sure that
you're only getting the object on the

499
00:28:19,499 --> 00:28:22,515
archive you're expecting to be there

500
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:26,732
also start looking for future
availability right

501
00:28:27,389 --> 00:28:30,740
classes responder selectors for reason
if you're in some code you're using

502
00:28:30,074 --> 00:28:32,083
somebody else's framework you wanna make
sure that that

503
00:28:32,749 --> 00:28:36,749
your code is gonna keep functioning if
something gets updated check to see if

504
00:28:36,749 --> 00:28:37,761
it responsible actor

505
00:28:37,869 --> 00:28:41,590
check and its class from string do those
things in order to make sure

506
00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:45,248
that when you're working with all the
stuff

507
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:48,830
you don't wind up at actually pension
user and killing a rap because with an

508
00:28:49,289 --> 00:28:52,860
exception of sending something to it
sending a message to a stringer

509
00:28:52,086 --> 00:28:56,110
ferryboat doesn't respond to a message
except conversion to

510
00:28:57,001 --> 00:29:01,012
okay so awesome great

511
00:29:01,021 --> 00:29:04,330
what households work

512
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:09,710
I pretty well actually

513
00:29:09,071 --> 00:29:13,500
if you follow me on the social networks
up today

514
00:29:14,139 --> 00:29:17,210
you probably know that I have a dog

515
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:21,097
this is my dog this is buddy

516
00:29:21,097 --> 00:29:25,171
he's got a sixty-pound barking a
thirty-pound bodies about the stall

517
00:29:26,071 --> 00:29:30,134
I'm he's cute and I put a lot of
pictures my dog because I

518
00:29:31,034 --> 00:29:34,085
can't really post anything about work

519
00:29:34,085 --> 00:29:37,149
I

520
00:29:38,049 --> 00:29:43,608
so a lot of people like to say hey Chris
dogs awesome

521
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:47,123
i'd you know can I borrow your dog might
want to meet your dog

522
00:29:47,789 --> 00:29:50,840
your dog be a great party my life I'm
not giving away my dog sorry

523
00:29:50,084 --> 00:29:53,085
can't happen but I am

524
00:29:53,085 --> 00:29:56,624
I am pleased to to talk a little bit
about a prototype that working on

525
00:29:57,389 --> 00:30:01,070
I'm it's called the

526
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:05,496
it's called but the gramm and it's a way
that you can take your pictures and put

527
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:05,642
my dog

528
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:09,392
into them

529
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:13,507
so

530
00:30:14,299 --> 00:30:17,311
what we'll do is a I'm gonna take a
quick tour through Xcode

531
00:30:17,419 --> 00:30:21,610
both on for for what I've done so far
with with this

532
00:30:21,061 --> 00:30:24,080
and just to walk through the initial
setup love

533
00:30:24,629 --> 00:30:28,080
an extension application framework I

534
00:30:28,008 --> 00:30:31,057
but you're gonna be able to do this kind
of thing the idea is a

535
00:30:31,057 --> 00:30:34,133
with the terrible pictures at this is a
beach in Corsica went biking trip a

536
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:36,492
while back

537
00:30:36,789 --> 00:30:39,812
our ride bound up here was absolutely
gorgeous

538
00:30:40,019 --> 00:30:42,028
we're gonna try and stay a couple days
but they were going let's do it this is

539
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:44,014
a great picture but I really missed body

540
00:30:44,869 --> 00:30:47,873
got about ten days by this point

541
00:30:47,909 --> 00:30:52,450
and it's a great picture but now now
it's even better picture had a min photo

542
00:30:52,045 --> 00:30:52,774
bombed

543
00:30:53,179 --> 00:30:58,191
by my dog itself

544
00:30:58,299 --> 00:31:02,370
we're gonna take a look at three things
but the Grammy application

545
00:31:03,009 --> 00:31:08,020
its order the iconic the user sees the
place for gonna start

546
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:11,160
right it's going to allow posting and
editing your photos

547
00:31:11,529 --> 00:31:15,470
and as long as there's a picture body in
there it'll post

548
00:31:15,047 --> 00:31:19,059
a we'd like to allow some comments on
existing photos in sort of a feed kinda

549
00:31:19,059 --> 00:31:19,135
mechanism

550
00:31:20,035 --> 00:31:23,084
you may have seen up like this before
somewhere I'm not sure

551
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:26,470
I and we're gonna have a share a posting

552
00:31:26,047 --> 00:31:30,226
view controller with the extension right
wanna share the code so it winds up

553
00:31:30,649 --> 00:31:34,655
in both places the extension is going to
allow posting adding photos with another

554
00:31:35,249 --> 00:31:35,312
aP's

555
00:31:35,879 --> 00:31:38,970
but not allow comments on existing for
trucker buddy feeding the extension

556
00:31:39,789 --> 00:31:40,848
that's the business for the application

557
00:31:41,379 --> 00:31:44,090
and that's actually one thing about this
architecture in the framework and stuff

558
00:31:44,009 --> 00:31:45,073
like that you wanna be really careful
about

559
00:31:45,073 --> 00:31:49,084
right you know one wind up with your
entire application suddenly living in

560
00:31:49,084 --> 00:31:50,163
the framework because

561
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:53,928
not all your applications can be
appropriate for the extension or not all

562
00:31:54,009 --> 00:31:55,017
your applications to be appropriate for

563
00:31:55,809 --> 00:31:58,970
Publishing's a third party framework
there's the things that are common to

564
00:31:58,097 --> 00:31:58,183
your service

565
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:04,152
inner things that make your app unique
rights you want to keep those two things

566
00:32:04,899 --> 00:32:09,460
separate and it's going to share the
post do you control the application

567
00:32:09,046 --> 00:32:11,050
obviously the framework

568
00:32:11,086 --> 00:32:14,125
is going to contain a shared hosting
view controller and

569
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:17,986
shared networking code for posting
things like that and the model code

570
00:32:18,769 --> 00:32:21,774
right all the stuff that makes up the
common things that the extension needs

571
00:32:22,269 --> 00:32:24,280
to know to be able to deal with the
object

572
00:32:24,379 --> 00:32:27,580
the applications also deal so we have up

573
00:32:27,058 --> 00:32:30,727
the but the grant application here I'm
and

574
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:34,315
a tap on it there's Biden course ago
this is the feed

575
00:32:34,909 --> 00:32:37,945
here I and we're gonna post something
here this is

576
00:32:38,269 --> 00:32:41,322
a picture my parents backyard in
connecticut a

577
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:44,875
in and looking very new england and
falling three pretty and I can't bring

578
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:47,621
but there cuz he doesn't like the flight

579
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:50,248
we've got this app you got the extension
they work together you gonna be able to

580
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:54,220
take data from the extension throw it in
the application

581
00:32:54,022 --> 00:32:58,541
and the code to your gonna share between
the two you're only going to use

582
00:32:58,739 --> 00:33:03,070
in the framework so you not to be
jockeying target United shuffling stuff

583
00:33:03,007 --> 00:33:04,059
around things like that so

584
00:33:04,059 --> 00:33:08,072
we'll take a look at Xcode so let's
let's take a look at a new Xcode project

585
00:33:08,072 --> 00:33:09,160
will start from scratch here

586
00:33:10,006 --> 00:33:13,435
mostly to give you sort of an
orientation before I start jumping

587
00:33:14,029 --> 00:33:14,076
around

588
00:33:14,499 --> 00:33:17,940
and touch the ground to show you what I
did so what we've got here

589
00:33:17,094 --> 00:33:22,163
is the start a say it had application
error page based application what's

590
00:33:23,009 --> 00:33:26,032
let's go with a single view application
here just for the basics

591
00:33:26,239 --> 00:33:31,940
will call this I framework example
because I'm not particularly creative

592
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:36,110
and we've got a a language choice here
I'm gonna stick with objective-c for a

593
00:33:37,001 --> 00:33:38,290
minute

594
00:33:38,389 --> 00:33:42,480
and we'll just a 0 I am NOT an
organization on to myself

595
00:33:43,299 --> 00:33:47,080
so will call that happen corporate id

596
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:50,237
desktop or create this

597
00:33:50,309 --> 00:33:53,317
so we've got here now is just an
application

598
00:33:53,389 --> 00:33:56,417
prime and there some

599
00:33:56,669 --> 00:33:59,730
different things here too to build
settings and build phases and

600
00:33:59,073 --> 00:34:02,079
all the stuff you're familiar with
you'll see the the link binary with with

601
00:34:03,033 --> 00:34:04,762
libraries bit here

602
00:34:05,059 --> 00:34:09,240
I if you're just gonna have an
application should be fine you work with

603
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,025
this new put all your

604
00:34:10,034 --> 00:34:13,109
your code in your tabs in the menu to
work with your target some things like

605
00:34:14,009 --> 00:34:14,016
that

606
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,144
but we're actually gonna go ahead and
create a new target here more will

607
00:34:17,044 --> 00:34:17,132
create a new

608
00:34:18,032 --> 00:34:22,037
framework in library target a Cocoa
Touch framework

609
00:34:22,082 --> 00:34:28,091
will call this a it's called what's the
cat

610
00:34:28,829 --> 00:34:31,834
and you'll see two new things here it
says here front leaf project is the

611
00:34:32,329 --> 00:34:33,970
framework example here

612
00:34:33,097 --> 00:34:36,173
and embedded application framework
example so we're creating this new

613
00:34:37,073 --> 00:34:40,222
up premark and we're

614
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,886
Xcode also gonna set up so that when a
framework build and then you when you

615
00:34:44,579 --> 00:34:47,584
going archive it all the time winds up
in the right place

616
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:53,083
as we can do finisher and now we've got
to the link binary with libraries there

617
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:56,141
but the kid framework is required

618
00:34:56,339 --> 00:34:59,910
and %uh let's go ahead actually create
the extension here to our here's an

619
00:34:59,091 --> 00:35:00,163
application extension

620
00:35:01,063 --> 00:35:05,102
a will use a share extension

621
00:35:06,002 --> 00:35:11,089
okay and %uh this will be the but still
posting

622
00:35:11,089 --> 00:35:14,188
extension

623
00:35:15,088 --> 00:35:19,095
okay now we've got but the kid

624
00:35:19,095 --> 00:35:22,100
but the posting but the posting

625
00:35:23,045 --> 00:35:26,924
bits had to share view controller in
here

626
00:35:27,329 --> 00:35:30,428
and a storyboard for that

627
00:35:31,319 --> 00:35:35,140
C

628
00:35:35,014 --> 00:35:39,063
we pause for station identification I

629
00:35:39,063 --> 00:35:41,992
there's nothing but the kit right now
there's nothing in the butt so there's

630
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:42,587
that

631
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:46,240
the certainty share view controller in
here I and we've got

632
00:35:46,024 --> 00:35:52,038
this view controller for the free market
example for the application

633
00:35:52,038 --> 00:35:55,007
one of the things I mention before what
I want to be able to had to share view

634
00:35:55,349 --> 00:35:57,401
controller be part of the framework

635
00:35:57,869 --> 00:36:01,480
right someone use that both in but the
gramm itself

636
00:36:01,048 --> 00:36:04,137
and in the extension

637
00:36:04,569 --> 00:36:08,220
but for posting is the extension I'm

638
00:36:08,022 --> 00:36:12,101
all this stuff if we go look what's take
a quick look at the Finder here

639
00:36:12,299 --> 00:36:17,780
actually if we go look in the framework
example folder

640
00:36:17,078 --> 00:36:20,147
right Xcode organizing all the code in

641
00:36:20,849 --> 00:36:23,874
a director is here but the

642
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:27,990
directory obviously directory hierarchy
is not necessary reflected in

643
00:36:27,099 --> 00:36:30,125
in how Xcode shows that in its

644
00:36:31,025 --> 00:36:34,354
and it's a youthful files in groups

645
00:36:34,579 --> 00:36:40,250
thing here but we're gonna just move
these guys up into

646
00:36:40,025 --> 00:36:43,364
here some I'm just making sure

647
00:36:43,589 --> 00:36:46,650
this your view controller part the bus
ticket group it's not actually moved

648
00:36:46,065 --> 00:36:46,114
outta

649
00:36:47,014 --> 00:36:51,020
the the directory the 10 behind the
scenes but

650
00:36:51,002 --> 00:36:53,009
you know if you feel like you want to do
that go ahead and move in with your

651
00:36:53,009 --> 00:36:54,070
version control system over into

652
00:36:55,051 --> 00:36:58,600
to the right spot here in the bus ticket
header I'm gonna go ahead and

653
00:36:59,059 --> 00:37:01,880
it says here in this are you should
import all the public enters your

654
00:37:01,088 --> 00:37:01,152
framework

655
00:37:02,052 --> 00:37:06,141
using statements like import but stick
it public header so it's too

656
00:37:07,041 --> 00:37:12,044
import

657
00:37:12,071 --> 00:37:16,126
but the kid share you control

658
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:20,124
poker completion

659
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:24,041
and we need to make sure that we change
these to be parlor right targets over

660
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:25,750
here on the on the right hand side

661
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:29,240
sure you control diagram is part two but
the posting target we actually wanna

662
00:37:29,024 --> 00:37:31,843
make up our the but the kid target

663
00:37:32,059 --> 00:37:34,780
anything you're gonna do it Fri Mar is
different than what you probably aren't

664
00:37:34,078 --> 00:37:35,089
doing before

665
00:37:35,089 --> 00:37:39,092
is within a framework there are some
designations for what a header means

666
00:37:39,092 --> 00:37:42,981
so you're actually gonna wind up adding
the header to be part of the target a

667
00:37:43,809 --> 00:37:44,890
framework

668
00:37:44,089 --> 00:37:47,093
which isn't necessarily something you've
really done before right usually use the

669
00:37:47,093 --> 00:37:47,099
headers the

670
00:37:48,053 --> 00:37:51,091
the daughter Angelina Torres is a party
the framework for the target

671
00:37:51,091 --> 00:37:54,163
the headers are just loose you never
wanna can distribute so this is a free

672
00:37:55,063 --> 00:37:57,144
market gonna handed out to people are
gonna be heading out other developers on

673
00:37:58,044 --> 00:37:59,100
your team you're gonna wanna tell us

674
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,099
whether this thing is a project header a
private header

675
00:38:03,099 --> 00:38:06,260
republican right so

676
00:38:06,026 --> 00:38:09,099
the prosecutor means that only things
within the project can see it

677
00:38:09,099 --> 00:38:12,099
the private header goes anything it's
market a private here goes into a

678
00:38:12,099 --> 00:38:14,175
private headers directory inside the
framework

679
00:38:15,075 --> 00:38:18,093
when that free markets bill right

680
00:38:18,093 --> 00:38:21,178
the public portion of it is obviously
the public attitude

681
00:38:22,078 --> 00:38:25,115
if the haters they're just in the
headers directory there make this a

682
00:38:26,015 --> 00:38:27,068
public header

683
00:38:27,068 --> 00:38:31,117
I'm you might use private headers
because just like us you've got SPI

684
00:38:32,017 --> 00:38:35,038
you don't want people to use but it's
really handy to be able to use it

685
00:38:35,038 --> 00:38:35,119
internally

686
00:38:36,019 --> 00:38:40,042
or across to project and maybe the SPI
something you want to publish later but

687
00:38:40,042 --> 00:38:43,421
it's not quite bullet proof enough to be
able to papi now

688
00:38:43,799 --> 00:38:47,510
you put on a private header if you
publisher framework

689
00:38:47,051 --> 00:38:53,053
don't forget to remove the private
headers directory from the framework

690
00:38:53,053 --> 00:38:57,832
because then everybody can grow ball
over so I'm

691
00:38:58,309 --> 00:39:00,386
and then down here in the butt for
posting thing well we're gonna have to

692
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:02,079
edit the target

693
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:06,740
so go back up to this framework example
here

694
00:39:06,074 --> 00:39:10,663
and if I look at but step but the kid
but the kid is linking with no libraries

695
00:39:11,329 --> 00:39:14,420
the framework example is linking with
buds ticket I need to make

696
00:39:14,042 --> 00:39:18,068
but the posting link with but stick it
so I can do is

697
00:39:18,068 --> 00:39:21,123
just drug this guy here now okay will
pick the plus

698
00:39:22,023 --> 00:39:26,071
will choose but the kid from the project
and now all those things

699
00:39:26,071 --> 00:39:30,920
will link together not sure view
controllers now part of the framework

700
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:34,990
its live ill but since but the posting
extension

701
00:39:34,099 --> 00:39:37,125
links the framework in the Apple Inc's
the framework they can both use sure if

702
00:39:38,025 --> 00:39:40,067
you control let's go ahead and build
that

703
00:39:40,067 --> 00:39:45,486
for the simulator and then let's take a
quick work here at what actually got

704
00:39:46,089 --> 00:39:49,910
produced so if we go look at I i move my
build directory appear on the desktop so

705
00:39:49,091 --> 00:39:50,164
be easier to find

706
00:39:51,064 --> 00:39:55,483
up Africa looking product here we've got
a couple different products based on

707
00:39:56,059 --> 00:39:59,460
on our on our tarde configuration and
our target

708
00:39:59,046 --> 00:40:03,675
here's a certain everything spread out
right so here's but the cat that

709
00:40:04,089 --> 00:40:05,210
framework years the

710
00:40:05,021 --> 00:40:10,900
the app here's my but the gramm
application I was building earlier

711
00:40:11,089 --> 00:40:14,200
for the free market example inside that
is now

712
00:40:14,002 --> 00:40:17,027
a couple different directories this Fri
Mar directory has the but forget

713
00:40:17,045 --> 00:40:19,184
framework inside a bit

714
00:40:19,589 --> 00:40:26,589
and what's what's good old school and go
work in the terminal here

715
00:40:32,059 --> 00:40:35,118
the old church in the past and a bus
ticket free merck has incited this

716
00:40:36,018 --> 00:40:39,095
headers directory and module

717
00:40:39,095 --> 00:40:42,193
models are generated for for use with
swift and and for the module

718
00:40:43,093 --> 00:40:46,169
a in at import director for objective-c
there some nifty things to go along with

719
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:49,070
that but those are those are things we
should read about the actual

720
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:49,175
documentation

721
00:40:50,075 --> 00:40:54,173
I'm so the free market built into the
applications that actually one thing

722
00:40:55,073 --> 00:40:59,127
to to be aware of is you're gonna have
multiple copies the framers on desk at

723
00:41:00,027 --> 00:41:02,066
the time we're not sharing frameworks
across

724
00:41:02,066 --> 00:41:05,158
sandbox boundaries right things inside
the same sandbox get access to the same

725
00:41:06,058 --> 00:41:06,067
framework but

726
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:10,119
we're not letting you use the framework
out some other applications installed

727
00:41:11,019 --> 00:41:12,035
even if it's one of your own

728
00:41:12,035 --> 00:41:16,039
right all the things getting better
directly applications here after still

729
00:41:16,075 --> 00:41:21,093
completely stand-alone items so what's
the

730
00:41:21,093 --> 00:41:24,134
go back to this and take a quick look

731
00:41:25,034 --> 00:41:32,034
here I because the extension is its own
little applications from things you need

732
00:41:32,037 --> 00:41:35,039
to be aware every things like and its
bond Old Main bundle isn't gonna work

733
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:37,048
exactly the way you think you're gonna
have to go work for assets

734
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:41,031
by bundle identify using a bundle API

735
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:46,048
know there is no but I ran into myself
that I introduced

736
00:41:46,048 --> 00:41:49,085
why you ask so

737
00:41:49,085 --> 00:41:54,138
and the share view controller has the
standard extension stuff here for things

738
00:41:55,038 --> 00:41:56,115
like is content balloted select

739
00:41:57,015 --> 00:42:01,051
these are these are I'm peculiar to the
to share a few Control orbiter

740
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:04,052
there are other API and all the other
extensions that are specific to those as

741
00:42:04,061 --> 00:42:04,098
well

742
00:42:04,098 --> 00:42:07,140
both actually take a look and see how I
sort divided up

743
00:42:08,004 --> 00:42:11,056
but stick it and buds to gramm I'm

744
00:42:11,092 --> 00:42:15,096
so

745
00:42:16,032 --> 00:42:19,045
there a lotta really similar things here
to the way

746
00:42:19,045 --> 00:42:22,049
everything up broken down I'm

747
00:42:22,085 --> 00:42:25,100
not really tall enough to point up there
but

748
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,088
you'll see that the I'm we got to feed
you control or any posting view

749
00:42:30,088 --> 00:42:31,109
controller which is it that

750
00:42:32,009 --> 00:42:35,014
two things to use on the tab view in a
demo or earlier

751
00:42:35,059 --> 00:42:38,066
and then the main story board contains
those two things and then

752
00:42:39,029 --> 00:42:42,078
there's a buncha model code is down and
bites ticket but the kid has all the

753
00:42:42,078 --> 00:42:42,160
stuff like

754
00:42:43,006 --> 00:42:46,033
a the public umbrella header

755
00:42:46,087 --> 00:42:49,166
right to just like you just type import
you I can you like it I date you should

756
00:42:50,066 --> 00:42:52,137
be selling your umbrella her up in your
framework to do the same thing for all

757
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:54,086
your public API in there

758
00:42:54,086 --> 00:42:57,098
so you'll import but the kid that age

759
00:42:57,098 --> 00:43:01,179
/url easter hope you will some I'm and
also all the model code down there so

760
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,160
the thing that manages a post is there

761
00:43:04,006 --> 00:43:07,008
and the post view the displays a post
with the

762
00:43:07,008 --> 00:43:11,074
the the dog a resizable there in the
sheriff you control and things like that

763
00:43:12,046 --> 00:43:12,071
mean

764
00:43:12,071 --> 00:43:15,116
done here in about 3 poster again it's
the same thing it's just the main

765
00:43:16,016 --> 00:43:18,091
interface story where the anti
storyboard which says when you call up

766
00:43:18,091 --> 00:43:18,099
one of these things

767
00:43:19,071 --> 00:43:23,114
this is a storyboard to launch into on
right now an extension

768
00:43:24,014 --> 00:43:28,087
that's it writers other logic that lives
in the framework that does all the other

769
00:43:28,087 --> 00:43:31,186
work thus ending at the data and the
medical asiana the other photo and

770
00:43:32,086 --> 00:43:32,161
things like that

771
00:43:33,061 --> 00:43:37,112
so making sure that you're pulling all
these things down in the right place

772
00:43:38,012 --> 00:43:44,014
is very very important most to the
thirteen years I spent doing Fri Mar

773
00:43:44,014 --> 00:43:47,111
I work a lot a really talented framework
developers a lot of this stuff

774
00:43:48,011 --> 00:43:52,062
is tremendously hard one lessons from
shipping software

775
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:56,127
right being clear being explicit

776
00:43:57,027 --> 00:44:01,053
having the right amount of API having
expressive API

777
00:44:01,053 --> 00:44:04,101
distributing things in the right way
being careful with your versions

778
00:44:05,001 --> 00:44:10,006
making sure you're working with data
safely getting the right abstractions

779
00:44:10,006 --> 00:44:13,043
right all those things make our lives
much much

780
00:44:13,043 --> 00:44:16,049
easier taking a free market approach
even the applications if you look at

781
00:44:16,049 --> 00:44:19,052
most or applications on the device

782
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:22,156
you know Maps has mapped it right

783
00:44:23,056 --> 00:44:27,063
and I would say health has health care
right

784
00:44:27,063 --> 00:44:31,141
all the things that make an the ap
function and useful to the user live in

785
00:44:32,041 --> 00:44:34,047
the apt all the heavy lifting

786
00:44:34,047 --> 00:44:38,073
all the shared code all the interfaces
that allow things to work with your app

787
00:44:38,073 --> 00:44:42,115
going those frameworks right it's a
great separation for us that's what

788
00:44:43,015 --> 00:44:43,062
helps

789
00:44:43,062 --> 00:44:46,135
ship software can be a great separation
for you as well

790
00:44:47,035 --> 00:44:50,092
there are some related sessions that
happened earlier in the week honors one

791
00:44:50,092 --> 00:44:52,110
tomorrow are creating extensions for OS

792
00:44:53,001 --> 00:44:56,047
and first-hand parts 1&2 were

793
00:44:56,056 --> 00:45:00,100
earlier go watch those for breaking up
things into the extensions in in the

794
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,003
character setting extensions up

795
00:45:03,003 --> 00:45:06,048
right and then apply from the stuff he
got here are some stuff you got from

796
00:45:06,075 --> 00:45:06,140
from

797
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:10,098
and Ian Collins talk previously in the
previous our

798
00:45:11,034 --> 00:45:14,110
to all that and ensuring code between
Iowa snow ice 10

799
00:45:15,001 --> 00:45:20,025
allotted you I'm work on both platforms
and a lot of the model code and things

800
00:45:20,034 --> 00:45:20,122
like that

801
00:45:21,022 --> 00:45:24,049
is actually share a bowl and much of the
extensions API

802
00:45:24,049 --> 00:45:27,070
was developed specifically with an eye
to being able to write

803
00:45:27,007 --> 00:45:30,021
as much cross-platform code is possible
with

804
00:45:30,084 --> 00:45:33,165
as little as the pound it's for target
OS is we could manage

805
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:37,090
right for you will be able to do a fair
amount a code-sharing

806
00:45:37,009 --> 00:45:40,042
even for extensions Iowa snow attend
that's right here

807
00:45:41,023 --> 00:45:44,047
tomorrow morning at 9am brayton early

808
00:45:44,047 --> 00:45:48,096
K so 37 actually fantastic remainder the
week enjoy the bash

809
00:45:48,096 --> 00:45:48,173
thank you very much
