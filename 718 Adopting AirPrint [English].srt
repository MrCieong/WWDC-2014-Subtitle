1
00:00:11,024 --> 00:00:17,093
okay good morning everybody welcome to
the WWDC 2014 pretty fashion I'm Howard

2
00:00:17,093 --> 00:00:17,179
Miller on the

3
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:21,148
engineering manager for everything
printing Apple I

4
00:00:22,048 --> 00:00:25,055
today we are pretty straightforward
agenda review a little bit over an

5
00:00:26,018 --> 00:00:27,074
update on AirPrint

6
00:00:27,074 --> 00:00:30,150
were spent the majority of our session
on I O S printing

7
00:00:31,005 --> 00:00:35,060
we're gonna show you the new IRS
printing technology that in iowa saying

8
00:00:36,005 --> 00:00:37,034
we're going to give you a demo that

9
00:00:37,034 --> 00:00:40,071
so I know everybody probably went to the
parties last night so we gotta wake

10
00:00:40,071 --> 00:00:40,810
everybody up

11
00:00:41,449 --> 00:00:44,453
how many people here have applications
that already print

12
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:47,495
all right we've got a good good number
how many here

13
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:51,093
have applications that you want to have
print are right

14
00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:55,540
by the time you guys leave today your
applications will be able to print

15
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:58,055
I know you can write the code while
sitting right there cuz it's going to be

16
00:00:58,064 --> 00:00:58,973
that easy

17
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:03,100
but if you don't get it done we have
allowed that follows a string come down

18
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:06,098
and we will get your code printing today
so they give you an update about

19
00:01:07,007 --> 00:01:07,014
AirPrint

20
00:01:07,077 --> 00:01:12,150
what is AirPrint you know this
technology was released with IRS 4.2

21
00:01:13,005 --> 00:01:14,038
several years ago

22
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:17,552
in our primary goal was to provide a
great

23
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,310
outstanding user experience pretty was a
pain

24
00:01:22,031 --> 00:01:27,010
really was painful and we worked on the
back to make it simpler but it still

25
00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:29,343
wasn't super simple we gotta I US

26
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:34,850
we had to have no drivers no software to
install no configuration

27
00:01:34,085 --> 00:01:38,094
user just wants to put their printer
connected to the network and then when

28
00:01:38,859 --> 00:01:41,070
they go to print there's the printer

29
00:01:41,007 --> 00:01:45,045
they print you don't need fifty million
options the printer should be smarter

30
00:01:45,045 --> 00:01:48,024
the printing system should be smarter
and that's what we did

31
00:01:48,429 --> 00:01:53,920
but we didn't sacrifice output quality
with AirPrint you get the fall

32
00:01:53,092 --> 00:01:56,721
print quality that Apple's come become
known

33
00:01:57,549 --> 00:02:01,710
to deliver for for the last couple
decades it is as good or in some cases

34
00:02:01,071 --> 00:02:03,095
better than what you can get from the
desktop

35
00:02:03,095 --> 00:02:08,108
no compromises were made your printer
manufacturer Prince a protocol

36
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:12,076
standards-based plus a little apple
secret sauce on the side

37
00:02:12,076 --> 00:02:16,077
and if you're if you're a technology
provider a server vendor

38
00:02:16,086 --> 00:02:19,161
I we will license you all this
technology zero cost

39
00:02:20,061 --> 00:02:23,093
I am printers

40
00:02:23,093 --> 00:02:27,097
you know we introduced with with the
dozen or so players from HPI I'm proud

41
00:02:27,097 --> 00:02:29,195
to report that we have a hundred times
as many printers now

42
00:02:30,095 --> 00:02:36,117
I if you go in any staples or fries or
or pick your favorite electronic store

43
00:02:37,017 --> 00:02:40,026
virtually every network printer they
sell now has AirPrint

44
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:44,114
in it I'm by my read about how for the
world's install base for printers have

45
00:02:45,014 --> 00:02:49,056
AirPrint n/a a yeah almost cannot

46
00:02:49,056 --> 00:02:52,145
find a printer that your mom would want

47
00:02:53,045 --> 00:02:56,754
doesn't have AirPrint last year all the
enterprise vendors came on

48
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:00,167
Kia Sarah sharp Toshiba all have

49
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,020
AirPrint throughout their product line
as I mentioned AirPrint

50
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:08,810
is available as a printing system and i
OS 4.2 in later

51
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:12,086
for those who've done the math that
means they're more than $700 million

52
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:17,093
users that have the same printing system
on it that's more than any other

53
00:03:17,093 --> 00:03:20,147
printing system in the history the
computing industry so AirPrint spring

54
00:03:21,047 --> 00:03:21,626
system

55
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:26,049
is the most prevalent printing platform
out there then of course the most

56
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:30,950
important thing is you're out and you
just gotta believe this I the Microsoft

57
00:03:30,095 --> 00:03:31,944
guys released a beautiful product

58
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:38,400
they left once more feature how and they
heard about it right away on day one

59
00:03:38,004 --> 00:03:42,203
and by the end of that week I was on the
phone with their engineers

60
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:45,890
telling him to check out the last WWDC
presentation

61
00:03:45,089 --> 00:03:48,154
within a couple days their app was then
printing course it to come by

62
00:03:49,054 --> 00:03:53,068
the better part of a month to release it
we're gonna get outta there

63
00:03:53,068 --> 00:03:57,457
what you need to know about airplane is
it super super easy

64
00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:02,134
the user interface is easy the user
action is easy

65
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:05,730
but equally important and probably more
important for you

66
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:10,340
is that that the API said that we have
is not some random walk through a

67
00:04:10,034 --> 00:04:10,126
hundred different things

68
00:04:11,026 --> 00:04:15,089
we have a very very focused survey PI's
that are very efficient to get you right

69
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:17,438
down to what you need to know

70
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,390
in with a little work and a little help
from your application

71
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:24,047
bring system smart enough to know what
to do with your output

72
00:04:24,047 --> 00:04:27,088
we can get super high quality output
without having to have a bunch for user

73
00:04:27,088 --> 00:04:28,175
interaction

74
00:04:29,075 --> 00:04:33,087
so let's talk about about what's gone on
with AirPrint

75
00:04:33,087 --> 00:04:37,138
we started with consumer inkjet we got
consumer laser we got enterprise

76
00:04:38,038 --> 00:04:42,093
lasers we've got some servers I'll after
we talked about brothers

77
00:04:42,093 --> 00:04:47,171
first role for printer and as things go
there are always new classes for

78
00:04:48,071 --> 00:04:49,108
printers coming

79
00:04:50,008 --> 00:04:53,067
and we're getting into some other
specialty printers are in store with one

80
00:04:53,067 --> 00:04:54,112
of my new favorites

81
00:04:55,012 --> 00:04:59,023
this is probably not what your mom can I
get home this is the Astra mad tuff

82
00:04:59,023 --> 00:05:01,096
rider 5 the reason I like this

83
00:05:01,096 --> 00:05:04,129
is because it's native spot

84
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:08,100
is on the cockpit of an airplane there
it is set in its native

85
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,006
747 environment I but this will end up
on C-seventeens with the military lined

86
00:05:14,006 --> 00:05:14,014
up and and

87
00:05:15,004 --> 00:05:20,061
commercial but what's interesting is
iPad and iPhones are everyplace

88
00:05:20,097 --> 00:05:24,124
applications need to print in the
printer manufacturers ok all types are

89
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:26,026
responding

90
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:30,062
I am this is a curiosity and then there
probably won't be millions are these

91
00:05:30,062 --> 00:05:31,068
printer sold

92
00:05:31,068 --> 00:05:34,164
but it shows that airport is pretty much
every corner of the world now

93
00:05:35,064 --> 00:05:39,079
another printer that I'm really happy to
talk about is the brother Roger

94
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:42,135
forty 40 this is a very small
battery-powered

95
00:05:43,035 --> 00:05:47,078
receded label printer I it will support
AirPrint soon

96
00:05:47,078 --> 00:05:50,143
and I will have a demo that later today

97
00:05:51,043 --> 00:05:55,124
so let's talk about what we've added we
have added some new API's and higher

98
00:05:56,024 --> 00:05:56,066
with

99
00:05:56,066 --> 00:05:59,084
a these are to support

100
00:05:59,084 --> 00:06:02,151
specialty printers in applications

101
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:06,073
if you look at what we did in AirPrint
so far

102
00:06:06,073 --> 00:06:10,089
every time you print the user has to see
our print dialog which means they get to

103
00:06:10,089 --> 00:06:11,136
pick a printer

104
00:06:12,036 --> 00:06:16,095
if you're doing an application I am

105
00:06:16,095 --> 00:06:20,130
for the lucky store checkout counter we
certainly don't want the clerk

106
00:06:21,003 --> 00:06:24,042
every day picking their printer every
time they print every receipt for the

107
00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:25,110
customer

108
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:29,025
here at Luckys least my lucky

109
00:06:29,034 --> 00:06:34,040
they have to printers their one printer
prints the receipt yet on Prince those

110
00:06:34,004 --> 00:06:37,005
coupons and they tear them off and they
give you both

111
00:06:37,005 --> 00:06:40,041
the survey guys will allow you to have
multiple sets up earners

112
00:06:40,086 --> 00:06:44,099
pre-configured by an administrator I

113
00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:50,111
that at runtime: the user the
application can select which printer

114
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:56,046
without the user having to get involved
so

115
00:06:56,046 --> 00:06:59,137
will have a bunch to take talk about
that in a minute I select the talk about

116
00:07:00,037 --> 00:07:01,066
some hence

117
00:07:01,066 --> 00:07:04,117
first of everybody's designing their
applications for the screen we've got

118
00:07:05,017 --> 00:07:07,085
some beautiful iPad with Retina displays

119
00:07:07,085 --> 00:07:10,093
but for those worse in the print world
that's pretty low resolution output

120
00:07:11,065 --> 00:07:14,083
also output that is backlit

121
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:17,162
when we start talking about paper you
have a lil much larger

122
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:22,089
campus a much larger space to utilize

123
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:25,097
and that means the you wanna lay out
your stuff too

124
00:07:25,097 --> 00:07:29,105
to make effective use to the space you
want to provide

125
00:07:30,005 --> 00:07:33,012
higher quality graphics you really need
higher resolution graphics than what

126
00:07:33,075 --> 00:07:34,158
you're showing on screen if you want the

127
00:07:35,058 --> 00:07:40,064
the output to be truly spectacular that
I want you to think about readability

128
00:07:41,018 --> 00:07:44,021
you know they don't print book

129
00:07:44,021 --> 00:07:47,034
that people are gonna sit on the couch
and read

130
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:51,079
with no margins there's always a big
margin so your big fat

131
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:54,088
some can be there and you can still read
the words

132
00:07:55,069 --> 00:07:58,154
consider what paper is it's gonna be
reflective

133
00:07:59,054 --> 00:08:03,067
lights gonna come off a bit gray looks
awesome on screen gray looks

134
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:07,070
awful when it comes to print it hard to
reconsider the contrast

135
00:08:07,007 --> 00:08:10,072
consider the margin consider the fund's
consider the spacing

136
00:08:11,035 --> 00:08:14,098
papers a little different than screen
and little just a little bit

137
00:08:14,098 --> 00:08:17,189
aforethought you can get spectacular
printed output

138
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:21,097
I with respect to the Print System it's
a smart printing system we do a huge

139
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:23,091
amount of stuff

140
00:08:23,091 --> 00:08:27,098
to help your app if you tell us that
it's a photo for example

141
00:08:27,098 --> 00:08:30,175
we will automatically pick the photo
trying

142
00:08:31,075 --> 00:08:34,106
pic photo print mode picked the highest
quality print mode

143
00:08:35,006 --> 00:08:39,044
skill the item to fit on the page
centered in print

144
00:08:39,044 --> 00:08:42,111
you're gonna tell us what you're trying
to print were gonna work all the magic

145
00:08:43,011 --> 00:08:47,087
behind the scenes in the Print System to
make sure the user gets the best output

146
00:08:47,087 --> 00:08:50,186
okay there are few data objects that
we're gonna hand you your hand us back

147
00:08:51,086 --> 00:08:52,105
and I just it's

148
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:58,420
you know the caviar don't roll around in
those in train tweak stuff don't respect

149
00:08:58,042 --> 00:09:01,501
these opaque objects we may change
something in fact we probably will and I

150
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:03,905
don't wanna breaker up in the future

151
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:07,550
and then the last hit if there's anybody
here who test the Raptors anybody to

152
00:09:07,055 --> 00:09:08,067
stir up

153
00:09:08,067 --> 00:09:11,105
okay least a few if you do you don't
have to go by

154
00:09:12,005 --> 00:09:16,023
all 1200 AirPrint printer models that
are available in the world

155
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:21,482
go back to the the 2012 WWDC session we
spent about 15 minutes on something

156
00:09:21,689 --> 00:09:22,727
called the printer simulator

157
00:09:23,069 --> 00:09:26,250
which is part of your Xcode release

158
00:09:26,025 --> 00:09:30,028
it allows you to simulate every comment
I printer including changing some other

159
00:09:30,055 --> 00:09:30,894
printers

160
00:09:31,389 --> 00:09:35,370
parameters so inkjet printers laser
printers row for printers

161
00:09:35,037 --> 00:09:38,306
you don't have to buy more by one and
use the

162
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:41,678
printer simulator to do your work okay

163
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:45,480
let's get to the focus of today's
meeting again our goal is by the time

164
00:09:45,048 --> 00:09:48,217
you leave here today you can create an
app that Prince

165
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:52,720
and for the media this presentation I'm
gonna bring upon my engineers

166
00:09:52,072 --> 00:09:56,751
tara Lynn and he is going to

167
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:04,399
take you through everything you need to
know to make your print

168
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:07,784
thanks Howard I'm tied it when I

169
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,641
apron engineer and the lead on me I was
planning system so we're gonna talk

170
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:12,664
about

171
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:16,233
am I was burning here a personal talk
about picking what to print

172
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:19,980
next we'll go over the API's had had
actually get

173
00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:24,713
output will talk about to the different
pinning you I options

174
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,800
so first this is our motto I think

175
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:31,356
we made this clear but I was praying as
easy but powerful

176
00:10:32,229 --> 00:10:35,293
we designed the AirPrint protocol to
scale from

177
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:39,873
you know a small consumer printers all
the way up to big

178
00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:44,313
enterprise-class printers and everything
in between and with every IRS really is

179
00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:47,794
we've been adding an expanding the types
of things you can do for my last

180
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:51,636
but we kept it really easy so we want
the user

181
00:10:52,329 --> 00:10:55,357
interaction to be really really simple
and basic we haven't

182
00:10:55,609 --> 00:10:58,613
added Diane added an added include
really try to keep

183
00:10:58,649 --> 00:11:03,745
feature creep down so providing good
content for printing this is really the

184
00:11:04,609 --> 00:11:05,632
most important part

185
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,844
I'm what we're looking for is bring it
up but thats useful

186
00:11:09,889 --> 00:11:13,720
attractive and high-quality I would like
to thank you this is like

187
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:16,121
high and graphic design I'll it's best
that

188
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:20,821
design your output I'm like a graphic
designer word and then use our classes

189
00:11:21,289 --> 00:11:21,316
to

190
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:24,612
make that happen that have approaching
it the other way around we're just

191
00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:26,163
looking at all the classes and trade

192
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:29,910
tweaking what you'd what you wanna do
first design and then use our classes

193
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:34,643
as howard said what looks good on screen
than I look good

194
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:39,750
on paper we also want you to make you so
the dynamic braking system so

195
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:44,403
I'm paper size can be anything and we
actually talk to the air print printer

196
00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:47,590
I'm we figure out what side burner
papers are available

197
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:52,177
some printers actually have paper size
sensors that can tell what

198
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:55,615
papers in an or the user can turn on the
front panel what papers loaded

199
00:11:56,479 --> 00:11:59,486
and so the print system is designed to
be dynamic to have

200
00:11:59,549 --> 00:12:03,573
it sense at all the way up to your app
if your app is dynamic about its content

201
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:03,861
laying it out

202
00:12:04,509 --> 00:12:08,576
then you get the full benefit that
printer hardware margins also very quite

203
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:09,217
a bit

204
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:12,618
sometimes bottom margin might be large
them margins on

205
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:18,167
other side might be really really small
so for all these reasons it's really

206
00:12:18,329 --> 00:12:21,377
best not to produce a fixed size PDF and
send it to the printing system

207
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:26,811
also another thing to keep in mind is
there's really two major document sizes

208
00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:30,065
for paper in the world US letter which
is very is in the US

209
00:12:30,569 --> 00:12:33,573
and then there's a for which is used a
lot of other

210
00:12:33,609 --> 00:12:36,708
regions around the world so if you
design your output based only on the the

211
00:12:37,599 --> 00:12:40,602
paper size that your region uses you
might be missing out on a whole other

212
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:43,900
markets so it's good to think about all
these different paper sizes

213
00:12:43,999 --> 00:12:47,056
and like we set the printer simulator
you can use to simulate these different

214
00:12:47,569 --> 00:12:47,635
conditions

215
00:12:48,229 --> 00:12:51,243
so good example have pretty

216
00:12:51,369 --> 00:12:54,431
is this map dictionary for kids this is
an app that

217
00:12:54,989 --> 00:12:58,067
let's you eat look at different
definitions of math terms

218
00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:01,865
in this case for a look at the Las
arithmetic and if you're a teacher and

219
00:13:02,729 --> 00:13:03,787
you want to make like a hand out at this

220
00:13:04,309 --> 00:13:07,323
you can print it out and without you get

221
00:13:07,449 --> 00:13:11,454
looks really nice that would be suitable
to hand out to all the students in a

222
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:11,576
classroom

223
00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:16,297
have the night header and footer there's
the page number at the bottom

224
00:13:16,549 --> 00:13:20,549
the examples our next call out boxes
that are different color

225
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:23,578
an Italian poet actually even looked
really good on a black and white printer

226
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,840
and if the the

227
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:30,970
quivers printing had US legal out in
their printer and the the printer

228
00:13:30,097 --> 00:13:34,836
I'll reported that back to the brink
system this app is dynamic

229
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:39,712
an at fits all the content on one page
it stretches out it looks good

230
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:43,012
so this is a good example a being
dynamic about to

231
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:46,098
about content okay so let's

232
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:50,695
step right into the FBI's here the basic
steps to printing with

233
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:54,322
you I this is a standard printing I
first your Apple get the print

234
00:13:54,619 --> 00:13:54,681
controller

235
00:13:55,239 --> 00:13:59,247
or the activity controller sure she'd
your setup attributes for the job like

236
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,093
job name in the type of job

237
00:14:01,579 --> 00:14:04,673
then you provide the content for praying
and we'll go over that

238
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:12,519
later me a present the UI at this point
I was takes over it communicates with

239
00:14:12,929 --> 00:14:13,016
the AirPrint printer

240
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:16,885
figures out all the relevant information
and the Damon takes over managing the

241
00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:17,708
job

242
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:22,155
if there's I'm if the job needs a
username a password that brings

243
00:14:22,749 --> 00:14:23,788
authentic scare that if

244
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:27,238
paper around our incomes irony in that
kinda stuff that are managed by the day

245
00:14:28,129 --> 00:14:32,165
Damon's hereafter need to deal with any
of that stuff

246
00:14:32,489 --> 00:14:35,534
so here's the classes were gonna be
focusing on

247
00:14:35,939 --> 00:14:38,953
first you I print and file the just the
general

248
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:43,150
I'm sorta meta data about the print job
the job name in a type a job

249
00:14:43,789 --> 00:14:48,867
you I put paper which this represents
sheet of paper at the printer

250
00:14:49,569 --> 00:14:54,618
a pretty for matter which knows how to
format content for she

251
00:14:55,059 --> 00:15:00,134
you a pre-paid render which lets you
take full control over drying

252
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:03,835
than for showing you I am here and I
managing the job we have you I printer

253
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,153
actually controller

254
00:15:05,909 --> 00:15:10,927
or you I activity view controller which
is the share she

255
00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:14,098
the first let's go for you I print and
file every print job should have

256
00:15:14,989 --> 00:15:20,026
are you I put in for a set up for it
first thing I do is that the jobname

257
00:15:20,359 --> 00:15:24,396
now this job name appears on the front
panel when the user printer printer

258
00:15:24,729 --> 00:15:27,751
are when he's a prince a job but also
appears I

259
00:15:27,949 --> 00:15:30,997
in Perth Center if these are on to
cancel their job

260
00:15:31,429 --> 00:15:34,438
if they're planning to a server are like
a press release server

261
00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:38,377
this is how you use is going to be
identifying their job

262
00:15:38,809 --> 00:15:42,820
that needs to be really specific if it's
something generic like just print job

263
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:45,982
that doesn't really help users identify
which jobs there's such are important to

264
00:15:46,549 --> 00:15:47,555
make sure this is

265
00:15:47,609 --> 00:15:51,706
specific as possible next we have output
type:

266
00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:55,671
this just tell the principal about the
type of content that you're pretty

267
00:15:56,499 --> 00:16:00,572
that lowers the the panic that them to
make appropriate choices for paper size

268
00:16:01,229 --> 00:16:05,294
pic quality mode I we also make you I
decisions about what to show for the UI

269
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:08,897
based on apartheid we have four these

270
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:12,106
first one just the general up you I prim
and proper

271
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:15,616
general this is like you know mix text
and graphics

272
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,455
like a web page are showing here

273
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:23,003
will tell the printer to print it normal
quality isn't that gonna do high quality

274
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,452
and take a really long time

275
00:16:24,929 --> 00:16:27,947
I'll by departures the document paper
size like

276
00:16:28,109 --> 00:16:31,124
a four-letter the UI lowers

277
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:34,278
duplex to be shown on page arranged to

278
00:16:34,449 --> 00:16:38,475
next one we have the document grayscale
this is very similar to the previous one

279
00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:39,718
but this is optimized for

280
00:16:40,609 --> 00:16:43,671
monochrome like text and and monochrome
graphics

281
00:16:44,229 --> 00:16:47,233
this case you get improved print speed
cuz we can tell the printer

282
00:16:47,629 --> 00:16:52,695
this is just black and white the data
over the network can be last

283
00:16:53,289 --> 00:16:56,342
and all silent many cases reduce their
money Inc but it's used because the

284
00:16:56,819 --> 00:16:58,824
printer will go into a black only mode

285
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:02,343
and like the previous example die I am

286
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:07,500
duplex allowed and paid range controls
will be allowed in and UI

287
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:11,144
next one is photo like Howard Mintz you
can tell us your printing a photo

288
00:17:11,639 --> 00:17:14,677
will choose high quality will tell the
printer this is a photo printer

289
00:17:15,019 --> 00:17:20,490
highest quality which is a photo paper
size based on the region

290
00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:24,075
if the printer allows borderless
printing will choose borderless printing

291
00:17:24,075 --> 00:17:27,864
and because duplex unpaid range I make
sense for a photo we don't show those in

292
00:17:28,539 --> 00:17:31,545
the IC get a really really simple you

293
00:17:32,139 --> 00:17:35,181
and then similarly we have high quality
grayscale

294
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:38,655
which is in all in most cases arm in
most ways at the same as the previous

295
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:40,980
one

296
00:17:40,098 --> 00:17:43,467
but some printers have a high quality
great game modes some have

297
00:17:44,349 --> 00:17:49,375
from graying Lincoln turned on pic a
photo in grayscale really really nicely

298
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:52,990
so we'll tell the printer to do that so
choose this if you what your

299
00:17:52,099 --> 00:17:57,124
photo to come out and I really high and
grayscale way

300
00:17:58,024 --> 00:18:02,833
okay so that you I print and file X will
talk about you I print paper

301
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:07,580
the really simple class just basically
have the paper act that represents

302
00:18:07,058 --> 00:18:11,027
the fact that the full sheet of paper
have at 00:00 on

303
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:15,250
just directing oversized sheet an
insider that we have the printable

304
00:18:15,025 --> 00:18:16,184
racked

305
00:18:16,409 --> 00:18:19,448
this is the image malaria on its

306
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:23,590
the where the printer can actually image
content so it's basically the

307
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:29,318
the full page minus the hardware margins

308
00:18:29,849 --> 00:18:32,881
okay next we'll talk about providing
content so this is really that the meter

309
00:18:33,169 --> 00:18:35,180
that the presentation here

310
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:38,313
and there's three levels here we have
are

311
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:42,510
the easiest way then there's a little
bit more it still simple but a little

312
00:18:42,051 --> 00:18:43,180
bit more involved and then

313
00:18:43,639 --> 00:18:46,704
fully custom ROM pages the first the
easy

314
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:50,440
is PDF files image files things that are
ready

315
00:18:50,044 --> 00:18:53,213
are basically ready to print

316
00:18:53,609 --> 00:18:57,683
protease it could be a single item or
you can be a real items like dad a bunch

317
00:18:58,349 --> 00:19:01,500
of photos you want to print you could
primary

318
00:19:01,005 --> 00:19:06,007
I'm it could be like I said PDF J pegs
any image type that I was understands

319
00:19:06,007 --> 00:19:09,061
it can be in the form have an ass URL to
like a file on

320
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:13,120
desk or they can be in memory in the
form of an enhanced data

321
00:19:14,002 --> 00:19:18,391
you I am CIA image it can even be
something in the photo library like an

322
00:19:18,589 --> 00:19:18,960
ass

323
00:19:18,096 --> 00:19:22,795
a laugh at cornell URL I'm interpreting
system knows how to

324
00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:26,990
go into the former librarian grab that

325
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:29,101
if you provide an array of items each
one of those items will be a separate

326
00:19:30,001 --> 00:19:35,400
job

327
00:19:35,409 --> 00:19:39,480
so here's all the car that it would take
to print a PDF file it's pretty simple

328
00:19:39,048 --> 00:19:43,427
this method just take then you're out to
a PDF file on desk

329
00:19:43,859 --> 00:19:47,000
first we asked the UI interaction
controller

330
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,029
if it can print this URL and some
examples of when it would be able to

331
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:51,690
print it I'll

332
00:19:51,069 --> 00:19:56,144
if the PDF hat was password-protected
offers now formed in some way

333
00:19:57,044 --> 00:20:00,653
next week grab the you I pretty
interaction controllers

334
00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:05,097
it's a shared objects we just grabbed a
share print controller

335
00:20:05,529 --> 00:20:09,585
with that the printing item property to
be this URL to our PDF

336
00:20:10,089 --> 00:20:13,116
if there was an array of items its
there's a different property company

337
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:13,441
items

338
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:17,215
the it set to be arraigned

339
00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:23,570
men we set up are you a pic info like I
said we'll do this for every job

340
00:20:23,057 --> 00:20:26,656
was at the upper type to be you I
pretend for a pic general because PDF

341
00:20:27,169 --> 00:20:28,208
typically have

342
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,564
mix text and graphics the job name will
be

343
00:20:31,609 --> 00:20:35,970
just the file name other the PDF north
at the prison for property

344
00:20:35,097 --> 00:20:37,786
up the UI printer actually controller to
be the print and for that we just

345
00:20:38,659 --> 00:20:41,711
created

346
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:45,320
next that the show is paid range
property to be yes

347
00:20:45,032 --> 00:20:49,051
by default but it's now but for PDF
usually users are going to want to be

348
00:20:49,339 --> 00:20:53,393
able to specify paid range within the
PDF to print

349
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:56,879
and i was just call present animated

350
00:20:56,879 --> 00:21:00,710
yes completion handler with no
completion handler

351
00:21:00,071 --> 00:21:03,122
at this point IRS takes takeover you
don't have to do anything else on your

352
00:21:04,022 --> 00:21:04,361
app

353
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:09,480
like I said if there's issues you know I
kinda paper any accounts that are

354
00:21:09,048 --> 00:21:11,107
managed by the system you don't have to
handle any

355
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:14,740
scares me

356
00:21:14,074 --> 00:21:17,233
okay so that's a easy level

357
00:21:17,899 --> 00:21:21,260
next is basic principal content

358
00:21:21,026 --> 00:21:26,625
we have just text or if you I'm written
your whole proudly outraged and now

359
00:21:26,859 --> 00:21:30,933
those issues when it is provided
formatter classes

360
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:34,643
so for matters but will be using

361
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,044
now what is a formatter it's pretty
basic it just

362
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:42,122
basically takes and in the abstract and
to take from data in your app

363
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:45,424
and some rectangle honest and I'll put a
sheet of paper

364
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,931
and it knows how to format sounds pretty
pretty basic

365
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,960
so in this case I guess being attacked
say we have the Gettysburg Address

366
00:21:54,096 --> 00:21:58,985
in an ass string we can use a you a
simple text formatter

367
00:21:59,849 --> 00:22:02,857
it knows how to take that string and to
lay it out onto a page

368
00:22:02,929 --> 00:22:06,760
into this rectangle now the whole string
doesn't fit on this one paid so far

369
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:06,965
matter

370
00:22:07,649 --> 00:22:11,480
know it's just keep going and tell all
the content

371
00:22:11,048 --> 00:22:16,687
and all the data did used up

372
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:20,198
so you can use for matters directly with
you I printer actually controller or the

373
00:22:20,909 --> 00:22:25,730
you activity controller the share she to
format for a whole page

374
00:22:25,073 --> 00:22:28,192
you can also use for matters as a helper
and a full render

375
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:32,460
we'll talk about that later for plain
text

376
00:22:32,046 --> 00:22:36,615
use this you a simple text formatter
that allows you to specify fontcolor

377
00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:41,210
linemen you know can't control the text
how you want to look on the page

378
00:22:41,021 --> 00:22:45,024
for HTML markup you use the UI mark-up
text formatter

379
00:22:45,024 --> 00:22:52,024
and it knows had format you know based
on its generals using WebKit

380
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:56,333
so the layout by default I'm here's our
paper like we share before

381
00:22:56,639 --> 00:23:00,660
I to file that uses the printable racked
which is the original area

382
00:23:00,849 --> 00:23:03,851
but that might be really really close
the add to the page some printers

383
00:23:03,869 --> 00:23:07,980
you know only have like oh attend two
minutes on edge the campaign

384
00:23:07,098 --> 00:23:10,797
like howard mentioned that's not a good
thing you don't want are content to be

385
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,746
that closed added page so that's we've
provided I

386
00:23:16,349 --> 00:23:19,430
a property on the format and you can use
and new this year we have

387
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,980
per page content inset the lets you
specify

388
00:23:23,098 --> 00:23:27,277
left top right bottom on every page

389
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,182
so will you little

390
00:23:31,389 --> 00:23:35,240
keep going until other content used up
and an honor those margins everything a

391
00:23:35,024 --> 00:23:35,963
page

392
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:39,244
previously we had a continent that which
is all behaved a little bit differently

393
00:23:39,829 --> 00:23:40,834
and we think this is a little better

394
00:23:41,329 --> 00:23:44,332
I'm that'll allow you to get nice top
and bottom margins

395
00:23:44,629 --> 00:23:49,632
and that are consistent every single
page

396
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:53,220
so here's a a quick code sample love
using a formatter

397
00:23:53,022 --> 00:23:56,131
and this is all the code you would need
if you had your print layout

398
00:23:56,329 --> 00:23:59,330
design HTML this is really all you need
to do

399
00:23:59,429 --> 00:24:03,473
as this this method here into the matter
text HTML text

400
00:24:03,869 --> 00:24:08,490
as a parameter we create are you a
mark-up text formatter

401
00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:11,948
initialize it with the text that was
past 10

402
00:24:12,389 --> 00:24:15,454
next week setup are per page content at

403
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:20,740
which is a UI agent that so I'll call
you added make

404
00:24:20,074 --> 00:24:26,081
ok but three quarters-inch top I top
left bottom right

405
00:24:27,044 --> 00:24:29,052
and then we'll just set the printer
formatter property on the controller to

406
00:24:30,024 --> 00:24:32,863
be the formatter we just created

407
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:36,148
they will set up are you I pretend to
like we always do

408
00:24:36,769 --> 00:24:40,804
just that up a general bud job name will
be there web pages

409
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:44,500
URL field

410
00:24:44,005 --> 00:24:48,053
and you put that so that's all you need
to do

411
00:24:48,098 --> 00:24:52,132
now view for matters I'm every view an
eye on has applied for matter that

412
00:24:53,032 --> 00:24:56,095
knows how to get that cunt an interview
on the page

413
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:59,774
I'm I was whether really designed for to
be view based

414
00:25:00,629 --> 00:25:04,200
printing go by some viewers are really
useful for this

415
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:07,026
so this example a map if you want to get
that content that a

416
00:25:07,044 --> 00:25:10,132
the map but in a MapView are you need to
do is call

417
00:25:11,032 --> 00:25:15,091
the view print formatter on your map you
and you can have this right to your pad

418
00:25:15,379 --> 00:25:15,458
controller in

419
00:25:16,169 --> 00:25:19,740
and prep another view that's really
useful

420
00:25:19,074 --> 00:25:22,503
out to to use the view prepared for
matter is a WebView

421
00:25:23,169 --> 00:25:26,220
if you have a baby you in your apt and
you want to get that content print

422
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:28,765
I need to call it that you print
formatter so you don't need initialize

423
00:25:29,539 --> 00:25:33,540
it on your own you just grab it from the
view

424
00:25:33,639 --> 00:25:37,500
okay so that's our print for matters

425
00:25:37,005 --> 00:25:40,584
so that the intermediate level I'm

426
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:44,111
the basic level next is you know little
bit more advanced

427
00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:47,475
fully custom ROM pages this is the view
this is for if you want to really take

428
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:53,220
total control over the drying and will
be rendering the pages with content

429
00:25:53,022 --> 00:25:57,701
using render is mostly but you can also
use them for matters like we just

430
00:25:57,899 --> 00:26:02,972
went over in render

431
00:26:03,629 --> 00:26:06,633
surrenders I'm what is a render well
here's our

432
00:26:07,029 --> 00:26:11,036
i render object and its really
responsible for at least two things

433
00:26:11,099 --> 00:26:14,170
first in which is responding to number
pages saw it happen now

434
00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:17,840
how many pages that total reprinting
netscape

435
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:21,158
to a response to next thing I have to be

436
00:26:21,509 --> 00:26:25,547
have to do is when it's called drug
content for page at index

437
00:26:25,889 --> 00:26:29,960
interact so the pretty let them tell
that draw the first page

438
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:33,710
and it gets to use any drying methods
better at it

439
00:26:33,071 --> 00:26:37,170
disposal so I any screen drying methods
car graphics core tax

440
00:26:37,809 --> 00:26:40,811
on you like it drying methods

441
00:26:41,009 --> 00:26:44,450
net told rather second page because
we've had two pages and so it just gets

442
00:26:44,045 --> 00:26:44,704
to do

443
00:26:45,109 --> 00:26:48,820
however wants to drop so this is what
you do for

444
00:26:48,082 --> 00:26:53,421
you know elaborate on put it up

445
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,730
so your subclass you I paid render like
I said at the minimum you override

446
00:26:58,073 --> 00:26:59,096
number of pages

447
00:26:59,096 --> 00:27:03,475
and drug content for page index it also
has

448
00:27:04,339 --> 00:27:07,470
the other method you can override like
dry header dropped footer things like

449
00:27:07,047 --> 00:27:07,846
that

450
00:27:08,269 --> 00:27:13,300
I'm another documented you'll set the UI
premier actual controllers pet page

451
00:27:13,579 --> 00:27:14,586
render a property

452
00:27:14,649 --> 00:27:17,654
to be this at your instantiated object
to your custom

453
00:27:18,149 --> 00:27:23,168
you a pager underclass or you can add
that object to the Rev actively items

454
00:27:23,339 --> 00:27:28,361
if you're using this year she you can
also add for matters by calling at print

455
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:29,220
formatter

456
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:32,181
starting at page index because they
approach formatter can start and end

457
00:27:32,379 --> 00:27:33,980
page

458
00:27:33,098 --> 00:27:37,195
how would you use a formatter with a
render kinda maybe a little bit

459
00:27:38,095 --> 00:27:42,095
complicated to think about but it really
pretty basic on so here's i render and

460
00:27:42,095 --> 00:27:44,074
when it's told to drop page

461
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:47,970
all it's doing is just its gonna drop
from flourishes on the top and the

462
00:27:47,097 --> 00:27:48,416
bottom

463
00:27:49,289 --> 00:27:53,352
in the middle we want to drop tact so
the render have the UI simple text

464
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:54,984
formatter

465
00:27:55,569 --> 00:27:58,666
here's a rectangle that we've set up or
what that text ago

466
00:27:59,539 --> 00:28:02,592
and our gettysburg address again you a
simple text formatter just formats in

467
00:28:03,069 --> 00:28:03,121
the middle

468
00:28:03,589 --> 00:28:06,611
some the one year's for matter to for

469
00:28:06,809 --> 00:28:10,470
T you know to HTML in a party your page
but then you want full over full control

470
00:28:10,047 --> 00:28:15,048
over drying up restive it you can do
that

471
00:28:15,048 --> 00:28:19,074
okay so showing you I and there's a
couple different options

472
00:28:19,074 --> 00:28:23,096
pretty from the share sheet as probably
where most people expect burning up if

473
00:28:23,096 --> 00:28:23,815
it's sharing

474
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:27,760
some general content and pretty is one
of the options

475
00:28:27,076 --> 00:28:30,875
this is where burning appears in most to
the built-in app smile ass

476
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:34,770
like here in Safari

477
00:28:34,077 --> 00:28:37,956
to do that it's really basic am will
just when we set up our

478
00:28:38,649 --> 00:28:41,747
activity items wildest at a print and
file

479
00:28:42,629 --> 00:28:46,646
which has job name job type and all that
you can add down to render like

480
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,852
this case and for the for this example
were like sharing a web page

481
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:55,200
and most the time when you're sure web
page you're sharing the actual URL

482
00:28:55,002 --> 00:28:58,030
but in the case for printing you want
actually render out the whole web page

483
00:28:58,048 --> 00:28:58,617
that's

484
00:28:59,049 --> 00:29:02,050
example showing now I'll just

485
00:29:02,149 --> 00:29:06,460
initialize are you activity view
controller with activity items that we

486
00:29:06,046 --> 00:29:07,685
just created

487
00:29:08,099 --> 00:29:12,106
and no application activities some
pretty good always and activity item at

488
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:14,261
an application activity

489
00:29:15,089 --> 00:29:20,116
an analyst for that using a standard
view controller methods

490
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:23,378
Sony other case spring with like a a
print button and

491
00:29:23,549 --> 00:29:26,584
you create and set up the UI print
interaction controller like we did in

492
00:29:26,899 --> 00:29:30,230
are examples for standard presentation

493
00:29:30,023 --> 00:29:33,112
your car present animated completion
handler

494
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:36,480
and for a popover presentation present
from racked

495
00:29:36,048 --> 00:29:39,447
in view or present from by about 9 a.m.
animated

496
00:29:39,879 --> 00:29:43,882
completion

497
00:29:44,179 --> 00:29:47,960
so happening at the menu item if you
wanna embed the pretty you I in your own

498
00:29:47,096 --> 00:29:47,535
UI

499
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:52,210
like in this case pages for you select
the print button

500
00:29:52,021 --> 00:29:56,120
at flights over get pushed into it like
a nap controller

501
00:29:56,309 --> 00:29:59,360
%um you'll set your class as a delegate
for the shared my printer action

502
00:29:59,819 --> 00:30:00,490
controller

503
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:04,458
you implement interaction controller
parent view controller

504
00:30:04,899 --> 00:30:09,710
so you'll tell printer action controller
which you should be apparent

505
00:30:09,071 --> 00:30:13,670
then when the user taps painting your UI
you'll just call present animated

506
00:30:14,309 --> 00:30:14,395
completion handler

507
00:30:15,169 --> 00:30:18,171
on the UI contractual controller and
then

508
00:30:18,369 --> 00:30:21,446
if you're class that you've told that is
the parent is a UN irrigation controller

509
00:30:22,139 --> 00:30:24,000
will get a push

510
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,002
and if it some other UI view controller
I'll just give him oral presentation

511
00:30:28,002 --> 00:30:33,005
but really they navigation controllers
with this is not useful

512
00:30:33,005 --> 00:30:37,099
now controlling paper size I'm if you if
your app is designed with specific paper

513
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:38,123
size as mine

514
00:30:39,023 --> 00:30:42,582
like a document center cap white pages
where the user's actually

515
00:30:42,789 --> 00:30:46,797
laying out their content I'm your Apple
have to provide its on paper selection

516
00:30:47,589 --> 00:30:47,647
you I

517
00:30:48,169 --> 00:30:51,280
this is a example for pages here where
you get to choose a couple different

518
00:30:51,028 --> 00:30:52,096
paper sizes

519
00:30:52,096 --> 00:30:56,965
when you use the delegate method print
interaction controller choose paper

520
00:30:57,829 --> 00:31:00,881
as call after the user selects a printer
we've communicated with the printer with

521
00:31:01,349 --> 00:31:04,400
the we figured out the papers that are
available

522
00:31:04,859 --> 00:31:07,908
and you then we'll ask for a paper size
that's a good match to the one at the

523
00:31:08,349 --> 00:31:10,970
user-selected

524
00:31:10,097 --> 00:31:13,726
if the paper had if the printer has
paper sensors or if the user inputted

525
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:17,606
exactly what paper they're loading the
array that get return will only be the

526
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:19,308
ones that are detected

527
00:31:19,389 --> 00:31:22,457
those are the only options available

528
00:31:23,069 --> 00:31:26,520
so here's a quick example have our
delegate method for

529
00:31:26,052 --> 00:31:29,078
on choose paper

530
00:31:29,078 --> 00:31:32,083
this case were looking for it in half by
eleven sheet of paper so I'll just

531
00:31:33,028 --> 00:31:34,587
created CG size

532
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:37,842
page size

533
00:31:38,139 --> 00:31:42,260
and then we'll use you I print papers
best paper for page size

534
00:31:42,026 --> 00:31:45,125
with papers from her a method so we've
provided this method for you on your

535
00:31:46,025 --> 00:31:47,194
iPad paper because

536
00:31:47,419 --> 00:31:51,431
texted pretty complicated to match am
for a destination

537
00:31:51,539 --> 00:31:55,240
for a target paper size from the left
the papers I'm

538
00:31:55,024 --> 00:31:58,943
kinda complicated and we've mediafir
easy we just recommended

539
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:03,173
call this next up is roll paper

540
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:08,460
on this was new and I'll 7 on its
similar to choose paper

541
00:32:08,046 --> 00:32:13,255
and that you can have a delegate method
called cut like for paper

542
00:32:13,669 --> 00:32:16,707
this is this method only be called after
the user selects a printer that actually

543
00:32:17,049 --> 00:32:20,520
have a role loaded and

544
00:32:20,052 --> 00:32:23,077
it'll have a you a pic paper passed into
it with the with

545
00:32:23,077 --> 00:32:26,120
up the role and the high to the paper
will be the maximum height

546
00:32:27,002 --> 00:32:32,080
that that the printer allows by default
if you don't have this

547
00:32:32,098 --> 00:32:35,103
the delegate method which must act want
and the and

548
00:32:36,003 --> 00:32:40,102
if the user chooses a printer that has a
role loaded the coupling will just be

549
00:32:40,129 --> 00:32:47,129
proportional to their whatever default
paper would be used for that job

550
00:32:48,021 --> 00:32:51,045
okay next up the a new thing and I was a
parade

551
00:32:51,045 --> 00:32:55,414
happy to announce I'm as pretty without
showing you I'm

552
00:32:55,819 --> 00:32:59,020
now the opens up the opportunity for

553
00:32:59,002 --> 00:33:02,361
new types of running applications or
really excited about that

554
00:33:02,379 --> 00:33:06,480
on wEDC this year's all about enabling
developers to do

555
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:09,096
new I'm interesting thing for you
weren't able to do before so we're

556
00:33:09,096 --> 00:33:10,065
excited to have this

557
00:33:10,929 --> 00:33:14,990
on but what does not for as for aP's
provide their own custom paint panel

558
00:33:15,539 --> 00:33:18,544
I wasn't designed for that and in some
ways you're not going to be able to do

559
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,076
that

560
00:33:21,409 --> 00:33:25,485
so here's our standard for and why I was
just break it down into some steps

561
00:33:26,169 --> 00:33:30,970
first what the user uses issue I to do
is to select their printer

562
00:33:30,097 --> 00:33:33,496
then the fat from options like copies or
duplex

563
00:33:34,369 --> 00:33:39,190
things like that and then they can't
print money actually wanna prep

564
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:42,094
so what we really done a separated
decided to things

565
00:33:42,094 --> 00:33:45,121
is still the these are still going to
select the printer

566
00:33:46,021 --> 00:33:50,680
but that's done up front and so for that
we have a printer picker

567
00:33:50,869 --> 00:33:53,938
and then to replace the settings that
they would be using we have ap

568
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:55,460
controlled setting

569
00:33:55,046 --> 00:33:58,645
an API and then we have a new

570
00:33:59,059 --> 00:34:02,710
print method on you I print interaction
controller that you'll be calling

571
00:34:02,071 --> 00:34:05,470
so it's kinda separated into things the
initial setup

572
00:34:06,109 --> 00:34:10,204
and then when you actually print so the
basic steps for printing without you I

573
00:34:11,059 --> 00:34:14,120
first your Apple include a setting for
setting the printer the prison

574
00:34:14,669 --> 00:34:18,270
the app setting somewhere Settings
button somewhere

575
00:34:18,027 --> 00:34:21,121
so to do that you first get the printer
selector this new class

576
00:34:22,021 --> 00:34:25,940
your present that you I then you'll save
the printer

577
00:34:26,129 --> 00:34:29,240
chosen by the users these are all be
choosing a prayer your caps

578
00:34:29,024 --> 00:34:31,203
responsibilities save that

579
00:34:31,419 --> 00:34:35,450
then whenever appropriate when your app
decides to print

580
00:34:35,045 --> 00:34:39,144
the Apple then get the print controller
the UI panache a controller

581
00:34:39,549 --> 00:34:42,770
of that up the attributes for the job
and provide content just like we did

582
00:34:42,077 --> 00:34:43,082
before

583
00:34:44,027 --> 00:34:47,074
but I'll send the job with this new
print controller method just sentence

584
00:34:47,074 --> 00:34:49,173
without showing you like

585
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:53,700
this point like before I left indicates
that the printer in the Damon takes over

586
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:56,105
Europe doesn't have to deal with any
that

587
00:34:57,068 --> 00:35:01,099
so here's the classes will be using for
I'm back company

588
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:05,101
first the new class you a prayer picker
controller that you'll be presenting

589
00:35:06,019 --> 00:35:09,048
NAUI printer object that your Apple be
saving

590
00:35:09,048 --> 00:35:14,687
instantiating between runs and providing
apt to the UI printer action controller

591
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,410
so everything that we've talked about
with

592
00:35:18,041 --> 00:35:21,930
you have been a interactions are still
though applies

593
00:35:22,299 --> 00:35:25,398
that your your Apple is required to use
this year I prefer picker controller to

594
00:35:26,289 --> 00:35:26,366
pick the printer

595
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:31,970
I'm it its complicated to show all the
different corners and sometimes

596
00:35:31,097 --> 00:35:35,496
uni using it on lock bernard has are
using a password all that kind of stuff

597
00:35:36,369 --> 00:35:37,760
is handled by the system so

598
00:35:37,076 --> 00:35:41,105
will use your printer picker controller
has the same presentation options

599
00:35:41,789 --> 00:35:45,210
as the printer actually controller so
you can present it as a popover

600
00:35:45,021 --> 00:35:48,910
or she eat or you can embed nap
controller

601
00:35:49,099 --> 00:35:52,196
then like I said your Apple be
responsible for saving Apr between runs

602
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:54,210
you'll save the URL

603
00:35:54,021 --> 00:35:57,130
and the nuanced and she ate a new you I
printer with justice

604
00:35:57,319 --> 00:36:01,327
URL the unsaved also this guy printer
picker controller allows you to filter

605
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:02,930
out printers

606
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:05,139
if your app is designed for just a
specific type of printer

607
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:09,978
and we'll talk about that later

608
00:36:10,329 --> 00:36:13,910
like it that you created set up the
opener picker controller I'm you can

609
00:36:13,091 --> 00:36:13,177
present

610
00:36:14,077 --> 00:36:17,171
with standard presentation present
animated or pop over presentation

611
00:36:18,071 --> 00:36:21,430
with present from Tractor present from
by about 9 a.m.

612
00:36:22,069 --> 00:36:25,390
I'm the completion handler though for
these methods

613
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:28,938
will I tell you whether the user
actually did like to printer

614
00:36:29,289 --> 00:36:32,670
if the if they didn't you know that they
could just cancel that so that all say

615
00:36:32,067 --> 00:36:33,118
that they didn't like the printer

616
00:36:34,018 --> 00:36:39,095
but then your app is responsible for
saving that pratt was elected

617
00:36:39,095 --> 00:36:42,924
so when you happens ready to print them
at the appropriate moment you'll use the

618
00:36:43,779 --> 00:36:45,806
USB connector controller and your call

619
00:36:46,049 --> 00:36:49,930
the new method print to printer with
this year I project

620
00:36:49,093 --> 00:36:52,122
completion handler be away from her past
10

621
00:36:53,022 --> 00:36:56,391
like I said can be obtained from the
opener picker control it directly

622
00:36:56,589 --> 00:37:01,610
or you could instantiated it with the
savior of

623
00:37:01,799 --> 00:37:04,990
okay so that's my printer picker
controller on

624
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:07,163
your printer new class in Iowa State

625
00:37:08,063 --> 00:37:13,065
first it has a contact her method so
this is used if your stance eating it

626
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:16,964
you wanna make sure that this printer is
there and to fill out the rest of the

627
00:37:17,549 --> 00:37:18,940
property is for the printer

628
00:37:18,094 --> 00:37:22,147
you have to contact you'll pass in a
block but the result black that'll tell

629
00:37:23,047 --> 00:37:24,696
you whether the printer is available or
not

630
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:31,500
might not be on anymore so it'll no
return no in that case

631
00:37:31,005 --> 00:37:34,043
next is the URL which is a read-only
property this is what you be

632
00:37:34,088 --> 00:37:39,143
saving out went once you get your
initial you April be saving us

633
00:37:40,043 --> 00:37:43,099
actually have display name which this is
our standard pretty you I

634
00:37:43,099 --> 00:37:46,146
the display name is you know they're the
name of the printer appropriate for you

635
00:37:47,046 --> 00:37:49,049
to show in your UI

636
00:37:49,076 --> 00:37:52,077
display location which is the smaller
tax attorney

637
00:37:52,077 --> 00:37:56,676
name you can use this for display in
your eyes while

638
00:37:57,369 --> 00:38:00,376
and then from various things about
though the printer like support a job

639
00:38:01,069 --> 00:38:02,146
types such as a bit field

640
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:06,660
and that of a like whether it supports
photo printing receive training were

641
00:38:06,066 --> 00:38:07,215
ample a brain

642
00:38:07,809 --> 00:38:11,170
different types a job that supports and
make and model and

643
00:38:11,017 --> 00:38:15,466
and some other capabilities

644
00:38:15,619 --> 00:38:19,390
so here's a quick accorded ample using
you I printer to show like the printer

645
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:23,050
name in a location near you I

646
00:38:23,005 --> 00:38:26,043
so first let's grab the saved for know
you're all from a previous

647
00:38:26,088 --> 00:38:32,093
run the application here just getting it
from the user defaults

648
00:38:33,038 --> 00:38:37,039
if we got one back from user defaults
will initialize

649
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:42,068
with your partner printer with URL with
the same for neuro

650
00:38:42,068 --> 00:38:45,096
and then likely contact the printer

651
00:38:45,096 --> 00:38:49,124
black that we will pass in we'll see if
it's available

652
00:38:50,024 --> 00:38:55,073
then we'll set our printer name label to
be the display name the printer

653
00:38:55,289 --> 00:38:58,470
and the panel location able to be the
display location:

654
00:38:58,047 --> 00:39:01,136
so these the printer name and location
unavailable until it actually been

655
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:01,633
contacted

656
00:39:02,299 --> 00:39:06,304
that's why we do that in our in this
block

657
00:39:06,349 --> 00:39:11,373
the pair is not available will have some
connection gone indicator ap

658
00:39:11,589 --> 00:39:14,611
if you want to have that this is what
you this is how you do itself

659
00:39:14,809 --> 00:39:18,380
like a little red indicator to let tell
users that their printers not available

660
00:39:18,038 --> 00:39:22,947
as a side

661
00:39:23,289 --> 00:39:28,190
okay so like I said you can use you can
filter out printers in the pair picker

662
00:39:28,019 --> 00:39:32,138
I'm for that this is you know offered
app design with specific parent in mind

663
00:39:32,309 --> 00:39:35,500
if you really only want your apt to be
used with receipt printers are with

664
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:38,064
you know specific type of fat burner

665
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:42,740
this is what you do I'm any one of those
properties

666
00:39:42,074 --> 00:39:45,092
on you I printer you can use to filter

667
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:48,541
I when you present the UI printer pick a
controller you're just use the delegate

668
00:39:49,369 --> 00:39:51,437
method should show printer

669
00:39:52,049 --> 00:39:55,101
your return yes or no whether it should
be shown so this is called for every

670
00:39:55,569 --> 00:39:55,960
printer

671
00:39:55,096 --> 00:40:00,167
as it gets discovered and you can choose
whether a good show online

672
00:40:01,067 --> 00:40:04,069
so we're really excited about that on we
really do think this will enable a new

673
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:06,928
class a pretty applications that were
possible

674
00:40:07,549 --> 00:40:11,520
on and to talk about some other new
types aP's I'd like to bring up

675
00:40:11,052 --> 00:40:18,052
I Cody Roberts opening system engineer

676
00:40:21,042 --> 00:40:24,068
hello everyone my name is Claudia
Robertson this is my colleague Charles

677
00:40:24,068 --> 00:40:25,977
dick

678
00:40:26,589 --> 00:40:29,596
exciting thing about you I was printing
is that it opens up the door to a wide

679
00:40:30,289 --> 00:40:31,364
range of printing application

680
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:36,094
whatever most requested features right
with a with two laps the ability to

681
00:40:36,589 --> 00:40:38,730
print receipts about showing the print
dialog

682
00:40:38,073 --> 00:40:42,096
in a few minutes child to demonstrate
how to do just that using a cash

683
00:40:42,096 --> 00:40:44,005
register

684
00:40:44,869 --> 00:40:48,440
we encourage you think more broadly
thing cover photo booth app that

685
00:40:48,044 --> 00:40:50,063
automatically print out your personal
photos

686
00:40:50,063 --> 00:40:54,522
or a label printing out to be you that
conference sign in table

687
00:40:55,089 --> 00:40:57,740
the fact that we're letting you say
printers means that you can help

688
00:40:57,074 --> 00:40:57,081
reconfigure

689
00:40:58,044 --> 00:41:02,051
up to print a more than one printer this
is a great feature that can be used in

690
00:41:02,051 --> 00:41:03,089
setting up multiple printers

691
00:41:03,089 --> 00:41:07,126
for each make very different function
think airline kiosk ap

692
00:41:08,026 --> 00:41:12,072
the person traveling check then enters
the number bad they're traveling life

693
00:41:12,072 --> 00:41:15,170
and after finalizing their information
one designated printer prints out the

694
00:41:16,007 --> 00:41:17,116
badge labels

695
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:22,000
and another print out their boarding
pass all about ever having to traverse

696
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,039
or even see

697
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:26,092
the print you I today

698
00:41:26,569 --> 00:41:29,647
to illustrate the power to new feature
and demonstrate just how easy it is

699
00:41:30,349 --> 00:41:33,650
to add you I whispered into your app we
have created

700
00:41:33,065 --> 00:41:36,149
a hypothetical cash register

701
00:41:37,049 --> 00:41:40,668
it catches ur Abbas something you'd find
animals any retail store

702
00:41:41,109 --> 00:41:45,480
and using the print the prin- paradigm
in Iowa 7 pretty northeast me know

703
00:41:45,048 --> 00:41:48,907
lot unnecessary interaction at the print
you I and there is really no way of

704
00:41:49,339 --> 00:41:51,364
getting around it

705
00:41:51,589 --> 00:41:55,170
after finalizing a fail in this demo app
it takes one

706
00:41:55,017 --> 00:41:58,456
to you three steps

707
00:41:58,609 --> 00:42:02,657
to print out a receipt each time the
clerk at the finish sale

708
00:42:03,089 --> 00:42:07,640
attic your side effect people and have
used for in less than ideal situation

709
00:42:07,064 --> 00:42:10,463
so what we know to be chair for the vote
for the most part in a given day at the

710
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:11,092
shop

711
00:42:11,569 --> 00:42:14,594
the creek or almost always print to the
same receipt printer

712
00:42:14,819 --> 00:42:19,690
dust we started our behavior the ability
to simply tap on the finish sale by an

713
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:22,408
and have our dedicated receipt printer
print out the receipt so the customer

714
00:42:23,029 --> 00:42:24,190
can quickly be

715
00:42:24,019 --> 00:42:27,928
on his or her way I'll now handed over
to Charles

716
00:42:28,099 --> 00:42:31,176
who will demonstrate how to update this
cash register up with the necessary code

717
00:42:31,869 --> 00:42:33,941
changes to achieve the desired behavior

718
00:42:34,589 --> 00:42:37,680
makes Claudia so what I have here

719
00:42:37,068 --> 00:42:41,101
is the code for the cash register app
that call you to show you

720
00:42:42,001 --> 00:42:46,070
and I want to update this to use these
new API's

721
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:50,380
so i cud said there's really to basic
steps

722
00:42:50,038 --> 00:42:54,197
to printing without the OI the first to
selecting and saving a printer

723
00:42:54,539 --> 00:42:58,700
and the second is telling I'll ask which
printer we'd like to save two

724
00:42:58,007 --> 00:43:01,606
so in order to do this I'm first going
to want to create a place

725
00:43:02,299 --> 00:43:06,348
to save the you I printer object then
I'm going to get

726
00:43:06,789 --> 00:43:10,864
when at a property here to my receive U
controller using the new UI printer

727
00:43:11,539 --> 00:43:12,900
class

728
00:43:12,009 --> 00:43:15,009
this is what I was his to represent the
printer

729
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:18,888
arm throughout the printing system

730
00:43:19,779 --> 00:43:22,838
next I'm going to add a place for an
administrator can go

731
00:43:23,369 --> 00:43:26,380
and set up the cash register in order to

732
00:43:26,038 --> 00:43:30,039
let the let the app now this is the plan
on going to be predicted

733
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:33,072
so will do that in the Settings button
so I'm going to go to my

734
00:43:33,072 --> 00:43:36,099
Settings button pressed method which is
a

735
00:43:36,099 --> 00:43:39,478
arm try which is the target action

736
00:43:40,369 --> 00:43:43,435
%uh a telling but in the app and I'm
going to go ahead

737
00:43:44,029 --> 00:43:51,029
and create he you I printer you a
printer pick a controller

738
00:43:51,017 --> 00:43:54,966
used willie create you a printer picker
control using printer picker controller

739
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:58,124
with initially selected printer to
scroll the controller to

740
00:43:58,619 --> 00:44:01,950
maybe a printer that we've already set
up

741
00:44:01,095 --> 00:44:05,934
next I'm going to use the you I printer
picker control method present from

742
00:44:06,789 --> 00:44:07,230
wrecked

743
00:44:07,023 --> 00:44:11,342
in view animated incompletion himmler
and when the pews and goes and select

744
00:44:11,549 --> 00:44:11,605
the printer

745
00:44:12,109 --> 00:44:15,520
will go ahead and check to see that they
did selected

746
00:44:15,052 --> 00:44:19,052
and if they didn't cancel the operation
save the printer that they selected

747
00:44:19,052 --> 00:44:22,138
in the property that we just created

748
00:44:23,038 --> 00:44:26,053
now I'm going to go ahead and update my
apt to use these

749
00:44:26,053 --> 00:44:29,602
new API

750
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,520
so you can see our print method as exist

751
00:44:33,052 --> 00:44:36,064
in Iowa 7 we

752
00:44:36,064 --> 00:44:39,096
do all the standard printing things we
create a print page render

753
00:44:39,096 --> 00:44:42,171
we create a UI print info sets and Rob
options

754
00:44:43,071 --> 00:44:47,114
and get the shared print controller set
the options on the job

755
00:44:48,014 --> 00:44:52,020
and then presenting using the present
API's actual notice look

756
00:44:52,002 --> 00:44:56,096
almost exactly the same as the methods
on you I printer picker control

757
00:44:57,014 --> 00:45:01,019
so what we can actually do now this is
what kinda lied about this API

758
00:45:01,019 --> 00:45:04,044
is delete sum up this code because we
don't need it will no longer presenting

759
00:45:04,044 --> 00:45:07,047
anything we're just gonna print to
printer

760
00:45:07,047 --> 00:45:12,166
we go then we can go ahead and delete
that little bit of

761
00:45:12,589 --> 00:45:16,440
auto-generated Co and it's really just
that easy

762
00:45:16,044 --> 00:45:19,122
also on the completion handlers the same
and we're now going to be a blueprint

763
00:45:20,022 --> 00:45:23,391
with that you are so I'm going to go
ahead

764
00:45:23,589 --> 00:45:28,250
and fire after the simulator here so we
can show the steel

765
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:31,041
and something that I

766
00:45:31,041 --> 00:45:34,082
didn't get a chance to talk about here
but it could be a logical extension

767
00:45:34,082 --> 00:45:37,118
is maybe filtering based on

768
00:45:38,018 --> 00:45:41,026
the typeof fenner that we're going to
use we we want to use

769
00:45:41,098 --> 00:45:44,100
only receipt printers at this out but
you know maybe a shop also as a photo

770
00:45:45,018 --> 00:45:45,080
printer

771
00:45:45,008 --> 00:45:50,008
arm and you wouldn't want to you
wouldn't want to

772
00:45:50,008 --> 00:45:52,082
print to that or you wouldn't want to
show that to the administrator when they

773
00:45:53,054 --> 00:45:54,055
were setting up the printer

774
00:45:54,064 --> 00:45:58,533
alright now we have our app and let's go
ahead let so maybe maybe we're in a

775
00:45:59,109 --> 00:46:00,220
coffee shop so

776
00:46:00,022 --> 00:46:03,093
let's get you know San Francisco coffee

777
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:06,182
and the you know maybe a bagel

778
00:46:07,082 --> 00:46:10,181
heaps yeah okay wanna home

779
00:46:11,081 --> 00:46:14,630
I it's let's get you know it weird were
splurging on today also

780
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:19,950
maybe we'll get cream cheese arm let's
go ahead and say for sale

781
00:46:19,095 --> 00:46:23,004
hoops I don't select the printer let's
go ahead

782
00:46:23,859 --> 00:46:27,070
and look for this notice we're gonna
pick this brother printer that we have

783
00:46:27,007 --> 00:46:27,048
here

784
00:46:27,048 --> 00:46:30,075
so wifi-enabled battery-powered receipt
printer

785
00:46:30,075 --> 00:46:35,126
now will go ahead and click Finish sale
and now I was will take over the job

786
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:41,028
communicating with the printer on you
know getting all the options at cetera

787
00:46:41,028 --> 00:46:47,107
and in a moment should be seeing the
paper come out at the front

788
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:50,670
and with that I'll headed back to Howard
who will

789
00:46:50,067 --> 00:46:54,098
pick it up I'm today what I hope you've
learned that is

790
00:46:54,098 --> 00:46:58,167
adding printing to your application
regardless asylum application is

791
00:46:59,067 --> 00:47:02,082
really easy for a lot of the content

792
00:47:02,082 --> 00:47:07,145
10 lines of code if you have pictures
HTML web to use maps

793
00:47:08,045 --> 00:47:11,434
you're set 10 lines to cope with really
nine if you count and I look at the

794
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:11,914
route

795
00:47:12,589 --> 00:47:16,020
I super super easy I am

796
00:47:16,002 --> 00:47:20,006
if you need more control a lotta stuff
you can now do with for matters now that

797
00:47:20,042 --> 00:47:21,045
we have the per page

798
00:47:21,045 --> 00:47:25,080
inserts we think our web viewing app sir
or a lot about $3 each

799
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:28,092
email based will only need those tens
lines code to print and print

800
00:47:29,064 --> 00:47:33,125
well but if you do need the full power
for control what you're doing

801
00:47:34,025 --> 00:47:38,032
you can always use a renderer which can
use any of the common to the printing

802
00:47:38,032 --> 00:47:38,131
API's

803
00:47:39,031 --> 00:47:42,068
are per graphics API to do print

804
00:47:42,068 --> 00:47:46,126
I and then you can combine for matters
with runners to make it super easy

805
00:47:47,026 --> 00:47:51,077
and the new and IOSA we as we
demonstrated you can now do

806
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:56,089
separate the picking up the printer from
the actual active printing

807
00:47:56,089 --> 00:48:01,144
so more information are technology
evangelist as polled ambled

808
00:48:02,044 --> 00:48:05,129
for those who don't know the name poll
has been in printing for longer than I

809
00:48:06,029 --> 00:48:08,328
have which makes it twenty three years

810
00:48:08,589 --> 00:48:12,450
I and he is readily available and can
answer many questions

811
00:48:12,045 --> 00:48:16,082
I we put up a new website this week
developer Apple dot com slash

812
00:48:16,082 --> 00:48:19,120
AirPrint this is your source for all

813
00:48:20,002 --> 00:48:24,025
I was printing related stuff there are a
handful sample aP's there

814
00:48:24,043 --> 00:48:27,140
all the documentation all the reference
document stuff that you're going to need

815
00:48:28,004 --> 00:48:32,062
is also a link to the list every I
AirPrint printer in the world

816
00:48:32,098 --> 00:48:35,120
every model order for printer in the
world I'm as well as

817
00:48:36,002 --> 00:48:40,005
information on licensing up the air
print technology so developer Apple com

818
00:48:40,005 --> 00:48:40,070
slash

819
00:48:41,015 --> 00:48:44,704
airport will get you everything then of
course if you've got some ongoing

820
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:46,914
questions you're always welcome to use a

821
00:48:47,589 --> 00:48:52,280
Apple's developer forms and then there's
a another point for AirPrint basics

822
00:48:52,028 --> 00:48:54,092
which lists all the printers

823
00:48:54,092 --> 00:48:57,165
know you guys are all probably pretty
experienced a

824
00:48:58,065 --> 00:49:01,141
application writers already but if you
if you still got a few details I do

825
00:49:02,041 --> 00:49:05,074
strongly encourage you to go back and
watch the video for the

826
00:49:05,074 --> 00:49:08,155
what's new and Cocoa Touch

827
00:49:09,055 --> 00:49:10,127
so that's it thank you very much
