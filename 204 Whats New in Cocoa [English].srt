1
00:00:11,076 --> 00:00:14,120
good morning welcome to what's new in
Cocoa my name with all the other I'm the

2
00:00:15,002 --> 00:00:16,021
director

3
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:19,748
frameworks at Apple so I gotta pack
agenda today we're going to give you a

4
00:00:20,099 --> 00:00:21,190
high level coverage of the changes

5
00:00:22,009 --> 00:00:26,460
in cocoa and North in Yosemite I'm gonna
get pointers to related sessions and

6
00:00:26,046 --> 00:00:26,945
relevant labs

7
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,447
as well and the topics recovering are
new look

8
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:35,240
extensions on hand of which are big user
features you saw yesterday

9
00:00:35,339 --> 00:00:38,960
and I we don't talk about them API such
a storyboard a new controllers

10
00:00:38,096 --> 00:00:41,445
API modernization effort we've been
doing of course we don't talk about

11
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:43,100
swept

12
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:46,780
and implications on cocoa and Cocoa
Touch API and a number of other topics

13
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:47,780
as well

14
00:00:47,078 --> 00:00:50,155
and to fight I wanna put this badge on
everything applied

15
00:00:51,055 --> 00:00:54,494
pretty much everything we're talking
about today is new and I or scan your

16
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:57,190
seventy or in some cases I was 8 as well

17
00:00:57,019 --> 00:01:00,084
okay so with that let's get started with

18
00:01:00,084 --> 00:01:03,153
new look there's very a

19
00:01:04,053 --> 00:01:07,562
components to new look you saw them
yesterday and you probably seen if you

20
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:09,390
installed your so many on your

21
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:12,074
machines there's an updated look for
controls there's translucent skin

22
00:01:12,074 --> 00:01:14,080
vibrancy there's new window styles

23
00:01:14,008 --> 00:01:18,967
and there's also a new font in yosemite
let's take a look at updated look for

24
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:19,845
controls

25
00:01:20,619 --> 00:01:24,610
here is the %ah good old found prep
preferences panel

26
00:01:24,061 --> 00:01:27,075
in a maverick and here's the same panel

27
00:01:27,075 --> 00:01:30,100
in Yosemite so one thing to notice is
that I'm

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,025
you know there's a lighter there's
lighter brighter colors

29
00:01:34,025 --> 00:01:38,096
there is a queen and simpler look I'm
not gonna go into the details here we're

30
00:01:38,096 --> 00:01:38,152
gonna do

31
00:01:39,052 --> 00:01:42,097
more of that in some other talks but it
is sort of a wider

32
00:01:42,097 --> 00:01:46,098
pressure look of course another thing to
note of that controls are pretty much

33
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:48,060
metrics compatible

34
00:01:48,006 --> 00:01:52,073
that's important important thing to note
here's another a comparison this is the

35
00:01:53,027 --> 00:01:54,030
add a new mail account

36
00:01:54,057 --> 00:01:58,059
panel one thing you'll notice of course
is there the default button in maverick

37
00:01:58,077 --> 00:01:59,136
this poll thing

38
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:02,900
continuously poll thing while the one in
Yosemite is not whole thing

39
00:02:03,539 --> 00:02:06,618
another thing to notice is the focus
ring the one in Yosemite is

40
00:02:07,329 --> 00:02:11,410
a lot cleaner while the one in maverick
is a bit by the they both a rapid

41
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:14,085
control but your 71 have a cleaner look
that's of course in line with the

42
00:02:14,085 --> 00:02:14,143
overall

43
00:02:15,043 --> 00:02:18,078
overlook of yes seventy now

44
00:02:18,078 --> 00:02:22,095
we have gotten rid of these long-running
animations like that the default button

45
00:02:22,095 --> 00:02:25,144
but we have some subtle animations in in
its place

46
00:02:26,044 --> 00:02:29,069
you noticed the radio button in the
opera operate them

47
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:32,148
they sorta gently respond York like are
your pictures

48
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:36,580
just like that you think it's another
some other cases as well such as I check

49
00:02:36,058 --> 00:02:37,100
boxes and search fields

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,019
now the good thing about all this

51
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:44,040
all these updated look for controls
they're all

52
00:02:44,004 --> 00:02:49,040
automatic in your applications I when
your application runs on your seventy

53
00:02:49,076 --> 00:02:52,077
it will pretty much inherit all these
looks and behaviors

54
00:02:52,086 --> 00:02:56,075
up I mean unless you're doing something
very custom using custom artwork once on

55
00:02:56,849 --> 00:02:59,935
your caps will get the assembly look in
fact we do not even sport the Mavericks

56
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:01,150
look

57
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:07,714
for applications on your sanity okay let
me talk now about translucent skin

58
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:08,690
vibrancy

59
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:12,106
the translucent see as you saw yesterday
castles and see the combination of

60
00:03:13,006 --> 00:03:14,081
transparency and blur

61
00:03:14,081 --> 00:03:17,840
and enable the purse now P of the
desktop or the content that you're

62
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:19,190
looking at

63
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:23,019
to come through in your Windows and

64
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:26,038
very aesthetically pleasing way so let's
look at

65
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:29,500
places where use I translucent be here
is your

66
00:03:29,005 --> 00:03:34,774
people to stop picture keeping up with
the party window with and desist are the

67
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:36,200
favorites view

68
00:03:36,002 --> 00:03:39,005
you see that the whole window has a
translucent background here

69
00:03:39,023 --> 00:03:42,532
this is usually not the case in most
cases know once you start looking at

70
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:43,540
content

71
00:03:43,054 --> 00:03:46,643
the translucency is usually limited to
the sidebar for instance

72
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:51,060
here in your I'm Nimes sure what's your
favorite app

73
00:03:51,006 --> 00:03:54,070
Xcode mail also had the same for the
treatment in five are you get the

74
00:03:54,007 --> 00:03:56,009
transport translucency in the sidebar

75
00:03:56,009 --> 00:03:59,158
area another use of caps associate
something like

76
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:04,060
up preview application here I have an
image and I am in school that yet but

77
00:04:04,006 --> 00:04:05,515
once I start to scroll

78
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:09,610
you'll see that to images gonna start
coming through the toolbar title bar

79
00:04:09,061 --> 00:04:09,550
area

80
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:13,188
of the window now note that this case is
what we call

81
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:18,260
in window translucency while the other
cases were behind a window or through

82
00:04:18,026 --> 00:04:20,114
the window translucent see their you're
seeing to the desktop

83
00:04:21,014 --> 00:04:24,071
here we're just seeing through the title
bar the content

84
00:04:24,071 --> 00:04:29,150
of the window to my document you other
case a path to see include

85
00:04:30,005 --> 00:04:33,034
the menu bar I'm sorry to menus

86
00:04:33,529 --> 00:04:36,690
and sheets as well and pop overs as well

87
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:39,077
have destroyed a treatment so traffic
through Cincy is automatic

88
00:04:40,049 --> 00:04:43,648
in many cases she menus popovers except
rap

89
00:04:44,089 --> 00:04:48,097
source list these are the table view
than outlined views which are configured

90
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:48,890
to

91
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:52,608
look like those sidebars will also get a
translucent the automatically in most

92
00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:54,440
cases

93
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:57,333
and also title bars and toolbars will
get a chance to Cincy

94
00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:01,680
in a number of cases let me talk about
that

95
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:04,157
whenever you have a window and you have
a ScrollView next to the title bar

96
00:05:05,057 --> 00:05:08,105
like in the case a preview you'll get
Rasmussen C treatment

97
00:05:09,005 --> 00:05:12,056
four-dot title bar area the psych review
does

98
00:05:12,056 --> 00:05:16,089
this is the case first an app like text
that as well

99
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:19,138
now in other cases where you wanna you
more sophisticated things are not

100
00:05:20,038 --> 00:05:22,113
getting translucent the automatically
for your title bar

101
00:05:23,013 --> 00:05:26,732
you can use this new I window style
mouth called NS

102
00:05:26,849 --> 00:05:29,917
full-size content you window mask

103
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:34,620
in addition we have I'd property such as
title visibility entitled appears

104
00:05:34,062 --> 00:05:35,721
transparent and this window

105
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:39,280
and I will have other talks were going
to depth about these

106
00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:42,430
but these new out features allow you to
do

107
00:05:42,043 --> 00:05:45,202
highly customized windows with
translucent see an example

108
00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:48,930
is the messages window burns's the
messages window

109
00:05:48,093 --> 00:05:51,512
has the circus but look with the
commentary on the right

110
00:05:52,349 --> 00:05:55,880
and that the five are on that left for
your for the messages

111
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:59,807
and if you %uh put this on top of art
desktop here you'll see that there is

112
00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:04,599
through window translucent see on the
left side in window travel some fee for

113
00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:05,800
the Mets just content

114
00:06:05,008 --> 00:06:08,307
on your right side the good news is we
have API

115
00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:12,104
for you to do this sort of thing in your
own applications as well where

116
00:06:12,149 --> 00:06:12,990
appropriate

117
00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:15,838
so you can do substantive design like
this

118
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:20,800
know byron see goes very much hand in
hand with translucency

119
00:06:20,008 --> 00:06:23,015
now translucent in general is of course
averaging

120
00:06:23,087 --> 00:06:27,006
the foreground and background but as it
blurs the background

121
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:31,120
and sometimes this could result in
reduce contrast

122
00:06:31,012 --> 00:06:34,038
and it could even result reduce overall
impact of

123
00:06:34,038 --> 00:06:37,107
what you're trying to show the user I'm
now Byron C

124
00:06:38,007 --> 00:06:41,008
what privacy does that help all the
elements out

125
00:06:41,008 --> 00:06:45,045
by a blending in fancy ways for instance
by using colored Dodge color burn or

126
00:06:45,045 --> 00:06:47,050
variants of such blending modes

127
00:06:47,005 --> 00:06:50,005
let me show you an example hear what I
mean here is

128
00:06:50,005 --> 00:06:54,924
a I'm no love you by Brent you which
include some tech

129
00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:58,455
and image and there now being treated
vibrancy

130
00:06:58,779 --> 00:07:01,990
not plywood to remove vibrancy from this

131
00:07:01,099 --> 00:07:04,518
you get this through slightly a know
what punch

132
00:07:05,409 --> 00:07:10,630
to that it's more more gray ash it's not
as impactful 11 at the vibrancy back in

133
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:13,158
it's really adding not punch that allows
the users content to come through and

134
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:17,327
separated from the background and be
presented to the user

135
00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:21,881
so this is vibrancy now vibrancy is
automatic in context

136
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:26,580
in most cases are applying translucency
and it's for controls and other and this

137
00:07:26,058 --> 00:07:29,113
abuse where appropriate but not
appropriate for all cases now

138
00:07:30,013 --> 00:07:33,042
example of that in a few seconds

139
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:36,510
now to enable vibrancy and also
translucency explicitly in your

140
00:07:36,051 --> 00:07:38,190
applications

141
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:41,650
we have a new view called an official
affect you

142
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:45,370
you created you I have you specify what
kind of translucent

143
00:07:45,037 --> 00:07:49,050
you want either in window or behind
window and you specify what kinda

144
00:07:49,005 --> 00:07:52,100
vibrant appearance you want you have
choice of dark or light

145
00:07:53,045 --> 00:07:56,634
and then you populate it with by been
capable controls

146
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,095
and you can recognize such controls
because they return yes from this new

147
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:02,623
property called allows vibrancy

148
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:05,908
and if I mentioned earlier some controls
offer

149
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:10,360
vibrancy they I'll Bay up into vibrancy

150
00:08:10,036 --> 00:08:13,039
at appropriate times let me give an
example of that

151
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:17,042
here's a window with two image use in it
on the left we have an ImageView with a

152
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:18,158
template image

153
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:21,817
and on the right we have an ImageView
with just the regular image

154
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:25,630
now this is on the regular no
translucent the window I'm gonna put

155
00:08:25,063 --> 00:08:26,962
this on Doc vibrancy

156
00:08:27,529 --> 00:08:32,300
and as you saw the the viewed imagery on
the left is applying the vibrancy

157
00:08:32,003 --> 00:08:35,097
and out treating the template image to
give it the appropriate look on papa doc

158
00:08:36,024 --> 00:08:37,043
byron back Ron

159
00:08:37,043 --> 00:08:40,081
wild elephant image remains put not
affected at all

160
00:08:40,081 --> 00:08:43,139
similarly fights which like vibrancy
again you're getting that

161
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:48,051
by twenty applied to the template image
wild elephant image against a spot that

162
00:08:48,051 --> 00:08:49,075
a No ImageView

163
00:08:49,075 --> 00:08:55,083
is dynamically deciding between being by
but not depending on its content

164
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:59,125
we made some changes mouth color we've
updated existing system colors

165
00:09:00,025 --> 00:09:04,083
to be a consistent with of course the
overall look of your seventy

166
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:07,130
and we also made it so that some and the
scholars have appearance

167
00:09:08,003 --> 00:09:11,021
specific very so what that means is

168
00:09:11,048 --> 00:09:14,050
I below you an example here is some text
use

169
00:09:14,068 --> 00:09:18,120
drawing a drawn with the system color
and hear the same text drawn

170
00:09:19,002 --> 00:09:23,006
on a dark fiber surface these are both
using a new system color we've added

171
00:09:23,024 --> 00:09:24,033
called secondary

172
00:09:24,033 --> 00:09:28,035
label color and you'll know that note
that in the dark fiber in case the Texas

173
00:09:28,053 --> 00:09:29,061
actually appearing

174
00:09:29,061 --> 00:09:32,158
white so to fairly different color so
you need to you know if you

175
00:09:33,058 --> 00:09:36,116
ever assuming I'm the color stay put
through the

176
00:09:37,016 --> 00:09:40,024
through like I'm a nap or in different
contexts notes good

177
00:09:40,024 --> 00:09:46,052
stop the sumptin and just use and that
scholars as is without taking them apart

178
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:49,068
we have a new pop and you think that
that

179
00:09:49,068 --> 00:09:52,073
the new park as hell but Cano yeah it's
been optimized for almost ten

180
00:09:53,018 --> 00:09:56,113
with metrics similar to loose the
grounding

181
00:09:57,013 --> 00:10:00,099
now you should obtain the spot with
methods such as a system pop-up size

182
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:03,142
which is of course what happened by
default when you drive elements out and

183
00:10:04,042 --> 00:10:08,087
Xcode Interface Builder

184
00:10:08,087 --> 00:10:11,182
and um now would for compatibility

185
00:10:12,082 --> 00:10:15,167
if you're up for existing binary
applications are already out there that

186
00:10:16,067 --> 00:10:19,098
applications which are linked against
the 10 not nine SPK

187
00:10:19,098 --> 00:10:22,126
or and earlier we do two things one

188
00:10:23,026 --> 00:10:26,035
if we see explicit references to lose
the ground they know you I element

189
00:10:27,016 --> 00:10:30,021
we assume that you really meant have a
deacon or your

190
00:10:30,021 --> 00:10:33,102
and we don't the replacement in addition
if we find out

191
00:10:34,002 --> 00:10:39,004
the text clips or wraps because it's too
wide for the area it has

192
00:10:39,004 --> 00:10:42,077
will compress it so it its debts so that
of course

193
00:10:42,077 --> 00:10:45,106
insurers compatible p for existing
applications

194
00:10:46,006 --> 00:10:49,011
now note that we do not do this once
your application is reeling

195
00:10:49,011 --> 00:10:53,084
3 built against the 10 not 10 STK there
we want you to take a look at your apt

196
00:10:53,084 --> 00:10:56,120
and correct any places where there may
be problems

197
00:10:57,002 --> 00:11:00,099
I'm now for secure funding up help your
controls are too tight and not fitting

198
00:11:01,017 --> 00:11:04,038
night like to recommend you actually
look at or layout as a way to

199
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:07,060
not only fix this problem but also make
your application

200
00:11:07,006 --> 00:11:10,031
a more forward-looking and more local
either we look like

201
00:11:10,085 --> 00:11:15,129
and so on laughing on the talk about
here in the section this in a segmented

202
00:11:16,029 --> 00:11:18,091
control we have a new style of segmented
control

203
00:11:18,091 --> 00:11:22,114
segment style separated it allows you to
do things like the backboard but then

204
00:11:23,014 --> 00:11:24,057
you see here in Safari

205
00:11:24,057 --> 00:11:27,140
it's also visible in a few other apt as
well I just a new style but did not

206
00:11:28,004 --> 00:11:31,068
represent the back forward buttons and
other similar kind abuses that

207
00:11:32,004 --> 00:11:36,083
you can switch to we have to relate to
sessions for the new-look

208
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:39,139
one this afternoon that up in your
adapting your apt to the new book

209
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:43,057
a of yosemite and another

210
00:11:43,057 --> 00:11:47,075
another one tomorrow which is a more
advanced talk where you can learn about

211
00:11:47,075 --> 00:11:47,164
how to

212
00:11:48,064 --> 00:11:51,101
used by been seeing more subs it ways
and create Windows

213
00:11:52,001 --> 00:11:56,099
like that messages ap you saw okay so
now let me talk a bit about extensions

214
00:11:56,099 --> 00:12:00,196
again extension to the future I you saw
yesterday

215
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:04,140
extensions provide accessed your app's
functionality and content

216
00:12:05,004 --> 00:12:09,053
in other APs for those of you familiar
with the Services menu from

217
00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:12,183
earlier or Stanley says so it's all
about the Services menu

218
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:16,165
start over spiritual precursor to the
speaker it's a much more limited scope

219
00:12:17,065 --> 00:12:21,110
version up two extensions feature

220
00:12:22,001 --> 00:12:25,050
extensions run in a separate process
from the app in which there been invoked

221
00:12:25,059 --> 00:12:26,131
which of course means there's

222
00:12:27,031 --> 00:12:31,069
security performance and stability
benefits

223
00:12:31,069 --> 00:12:34,146
and extensions are delivered with ap as
this think bundles within

224
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:39,057
the application so as you ship a nap on
the App Store or

225
00:12:39,057 --> 00:12:42,064
wherever you may ship it you may bundled
extensions inside of it end the users

226
00:12:43,027 --> 00:12:45,034
can enable those extensions if they

227
00:12:45,034 --> 00:12:49,055
find them useful not an extension
through application

228
00:12:49,055 --> 00:12:52,064
in Xcode you would go ahead and specify
that you want a new target within your

229
00:12:53,045 --> 00:12:54,122
application project

230
00:12:55,022 --> 00:13:00,031
and then on North can you have choice of
four extensions

231
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:03,096
action extensions are like extensions
you saw yesterday

232
00:13:03,096 --> 00:13:07,143
the markup extension they work with and
this excuse and web use

233
00:13:08,043 --> 00:13:11,089
a and a the translate

234
00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:14,097
extension use on afternoon is out or
maybe the morning after which

235
00:13:15,069 --> 00:13:19,085
was also another example of that finder
think extensions let you customize

236
00:13:19,085 --> 00:13:22,109
finders drawing in a safe manner

237
00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:27,062
share extensions allow you to extend the
share menu

238
00:13:27,062 --> 00:13:30,085
and today extensions August augment to
today view

239
00:13:30,085 --> 00:13:33,177
in the Notification Center point since
like reminders and you saw examples of

240
00:13:34,077 --> 00:13:34,139
this

241
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:40,047
yesterday not to use extension their
three new API three new classes

242
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:44,020
let me just show you how you would use
these in your extension

243
00:13:44,002 --> 00:13:47,066
inside after extension you have a
principal class

244
00:13:47,084 --> 00:13:50,085
with something you typically specify and
tell us

245
00:13:50,094 --> 00:13:53,190
for you I base extension it would be a
subclass of in SU controller are you I

246
00:13:54,009 --> 00:13:55,023
view controller

247
00:13:56,004 --> 00:13:59,026
the principal class has appointed
extension contact

248
00:13:59,026 --> 00:14:03,080
which is basically the central point for
that extensions data

249
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:06,022
and an extension context has an array of
another extension

250
00:14:06,094 --> 00:14:09,125
items where he cannot extension item
represent

251
00:14:10,025 --> 00:14:13,060
8 data that the user one operate on

252
00:14:13,006 --> 00:14:16,045
points in the case of the markup
extension the image that the user wants

253
00:14:16,099 --> 00:14:17,198
to edit

254
00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:21,240
would be represented by hand extension
item

255
00:14:21,024 --> 00:14:25,024
internet each and its extension item
points array of item providers

256
00:14:25,024 --> 00:14:28,031
item providers are basically what makes
the data

257
00:14:28,031 --> 00:14:31,063
for that extension item available there
might be one

258
00:14:31,063 --> 00:14:34,067
there might be more and extension can
choose which provided

259
00:14:34,067 --> 00:14:37,163
once use it's pretty straightforward you
these API

260
00:14:38,063 --> 00:14:41,091
inside after extension to get the
derailed items

261
00:14:41,091 --> 00:14:44,143
you would just say extension context
that input items

262
00:14:45,043 --> 00:14:48,048
and then you know you work on them are
you like to use our work on them as in

263
00:14:48,048 --> 00:14:48,117
the case of

264
00:14:49,017 --> 00:14:52,038
mark-up when you're done you want to
return to results

265
00:14:52,038 --> 00:14:55,071
you put them in an array or maybe that's
an array of one of course if there's

266
00:14:55,071 --> 00:14:56,073
only one result

267
00:14:56,073 --> 00:14:59,166
may call this a PI complete requests
returning items completion handler

268
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:03,099
now but turns out the user canceled the
operation

269
00:15:03,099 --> 00:15:06,137
or there was an error you can call the
other API cancel request

270
00:15:07,037 --> 00:15:11,122
with are so it's pretty straightforward
yep two sessions for extensions

271
00:15:12,022 --> 00:15:15,075
want this afternoon creating extensions
part 1

272
00:15:15,075 --> 00:15:18,161
and another one tomorrow morning both
talk about hand-off

273
00:15:19,061 --> 00:15:22,088
again feature you saw yesterday at the
keynote

274
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:26,091
hand-off enables users to seamlessly
transition activities between their

275
00:15:27,018 --> 00:15:28,065
devices

276
00:15:28,065 --> 00:15:31,066
and there is a simple bass API here
called and that

277
00:15:31,066 --> 00:15:35,150
user activity and their related API than
enough application in this document and

278
00:15:36,005 --> 00:15:37,013
thats responder

279
00:15:37,058 --> 00:15:40,082
and also in there you like it
counterparts as well that you know the

280
00:15:40,082 --> 00:15:40,171
cross-platform

281
00:15:41,071 --> 00:15:45,170
feature in the future activity
encapsulate

282
00:15:46,007 --> 00:15:51,039
hand of information about a single user
activity

283
00:15:52,002 --> 00:15:55,068
so you create one I would in it with it
activity type

284
00:15:55,068 --> 00:15:59,077
you specify is sir I don't fire with for
the activity user might be doing whether

285
00:15:59,077 --> 00:16:01,396
it's browsing the web page playing a
game

286
00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:07,089
editing a document whatever and then you
go ahead and use at various information

287
00:16:07,089 --> 00:16:11,120
a that would enable recreating a
activity another device

288
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:14,630
as you can see here maybe the level the
location the score that you're in the

289
00:16:14,063 --> 00:16:14,150
game

290
00:16:15,005 --> 00:16:19,019
and even going in for a title which is
usable title for that activity

291
00:16:19,064 --> 00:16:22,068
and then at appropriate times you make
that current

292
00:16:22,068 --> 00:16:25,227
or you tell it's no longer current in
the system apparently

293
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,820
system looks at what activities current
and make available to other nearby

294
00:16:29,082 --> 00:16:32,086
devices as appropriate we just need to
worry about telling us

295
00:16:33,022 --> 00:16:37,057
whence current in months not current
look pretty straightforward

296
00:16:37,057 --> 00:16:41,326
enough application we have several API's
the first one here

297
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,490
indicates few that the user has
indicated an interest in moving activity

298
00:16:45,049 --> 00:16:46,057
to your device

299
00:16:46,057 --> 00:16:50,088
and you can return yet if you out are
handling it or you can read

300
00:16:50,088 --> 00:16:54,132
return 0 and let the system handle it
the next API application continues her

301
00:16:55,032 --> 00:16:55,129
activity

302
00:16:56,029 --> 00:16:59,037
actually gives you then this user
activity which has the data from which

303
00:16:59,037 --> 00:17:02,045
you can recreate the activity

304
00:17:02,045 --> 00:17:05,127
not you're using and this document
there's easy hand of sport bike lock

305
00:17:06,027 --> 00:17:06,124
documents you

306
00:17:07,024 --> 00:17:10,047
really just have to do one thing and
that is at the ski

307
00:17:10,047 --> 00:17:13,616
here in for that P left for your
document type: indicating that you are

308
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:16,130
sporting hand-off for this document

309
00:17:16,013 --> 00:17:19,792
you specify a unique type i dont fire as
you can see her calm but Apple not

310
00:17:19,909 --> 00:17:20,620
accept that

311
00:17:20,062 --> 00:17:23,141
editing not gonna do something more
sophisticated

312
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:27,270
for instance specified selection or a
some other

313
00:17:27,027 --> 00:17:30,063
viewing parameters with that hand of I'm
information

314
00:17:30,063 --> 00:17:33,146
you have a handle to the user activity
of a fan of document that you can

315
00:17:34,046 --> 00:17:37,144
that the parameters in next time to talk
about storyboards and U controller

316
00:17:38,044 --> 00:17:38,136
switches

317
00:17:39,036 --> 00:17:42,040
set up new API for adding two of us 10
now if you

318
00:17:42,076 --> 00:17:45,080
done I with development you're very
likely familiar with

319
00:17:45,008 --> 00:17:48,017
concept of storyboard storyboard the
visual representation of the user

320
00:17:49,007 --> 00:17:49,075
interface

321
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:53,117
of your application so it's giving you a
higher level

322
00:17:54,017 --> 00:17:57,526
you of your user interface with higher
level than

323
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:02,717
creating individual names and may be
sending party connections together

324
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:06,070
I'm and if you wanna just create a
storyboard applications fairly

325
00:18:06,007 --> 00:18:09,014
straightforward in Xcode as you're
creating your new app you just go check

326
00:18:09,014 --> 00:18:10,014
the checkbox

327
00:18:10,014 --> 00:18:14,052
couldn't be simpler at and will give you
a default template that you can

328
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:18,064
modify from there now storyboard specify
different parts of your UI

329
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:22,066
as different scenes and then you would
use segways to connect or transition

330
00:18:22,084 --> 00:18:22,146
between

331
00:18:23,046 --> 00:18:27,125
these storyboards between the thin

332
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:32,034
their two classes and a storyboard and
storyboard segue these are

333
00:18:32,034 --> 00:18:36,040
very are parallel to their UI kit
counterparts

334
00:18:36,004 --> 00:18:39,017
we also have a new protocol segue
performing

335
00:18:39,053 --> 00:18:42,101
just collect the Segway performing
methods because on our

336
00:18:43,001 --> 00:18:46,050
can we have two classes that respond to
these methods view controller

337
00:18:46,005 --> 00:18:50,032
and window controller as well so they
both respond to these I think what

338
00:18:50,077 --> 00:18:50,175
performing that that's

339
00:18:51,075 --> 00:18:54,157
in addition these two classes also
provide access to the storyboard be a

340
00:18:55,057 --> 00:18:58,124
a property so you can get find out the
storyboard that they came from that they

341
00:18:59,024 --> 00:19:00,075
were created from

342
00:19:00,075 --> 00:19:03,122
now we have two new view controllers as
well that of course

343
00:19:04,022 --> 00:19:07,117
help you create better storyboards have
your controller and

344
00:19:08,017 --> 00:19:11,035
with your controller and day they

345
00:19:11,035 --> 00:19:14,117
no in spirit there similar to ours
counterpart there's a few differences

346
00:19:15,017 --> 00:19:18,095
let me tell you how these work

347
00:19:18,095 --> 00:19:21,176
so you have a cab your controller the
tablet controller has an array of

348
00:19:22,076 --> 00:19:25,135
an effort have you items now you might
be familiar with Anna have you item

349
00:19:26,035 --> 00:19:29,039
the class we had for a long time we
augment just a bit

350
00:19:29,075 --> 00:19:32,116
to work with you controllers each tab
you I don't

351
00:19:33,016 --> 00:19:36,074
intern has a new property view
controller and that might

352
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:40,080
point to a view controller in the case
of a cab view controller setup like this

353
00:19:41,034 --> 00:19:44,091
that's pretty straightforward let me
show you how you create one of these are

354
00:19:44,091 --> 00:19:46,110
structures

355
00:19:47,001 --> 00:19:51,070
there are two ways to do it to add a
trial controller to a tabbed view

356
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:51,167
controller

357
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:55,113
one where you could do it is you just
first create item

358
00:19:56,013 --> 00:19:59,055
enough have you I don't have you I then
the few controller

359
00:19:59,055 --> 00:20:02,064
you go through that and that creates so
that creates that

360
00:20:02,064 --> 00:20:05,075
a relationship there you can go ahead
and set their

361
00:20:05,075 --> 00:20:08,104
properties on the item

362
00:20:09,004 --> 00:20:12,091
point since its label and whatever else
you want and then you go ahead and add

363
00:20:12,091 --> 00:20:12,164
the item

364
00:20:13,064 --> 00:20:17,066
to the view controller with at have the
item so this is one way to do it

365
00:20:17,066 --> 00:20:20,138
another way to do it it simply take the
trial view controller

366
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:24,101
this guy here and added to the tablet
controller directly without the child

367
00:20:25,001 --> 00:20:28,072
new controller which is the generic API
we expose an issue controller

368
00:20:28,072 --> 00:20:31,090
this will automatically create the tab
you item for you and inserted in there

369
00:20:31,009 --> 00:20:31,091
so this is the

370
00:20:32,072 --> 00:20:35,078
it through the approach you on the use
if you want to deal with the item at all

371
00:20:36,032 --> 00:20:39,033
but if you do wanna said properties on
the item later

372
00:20:39,033 --> 00:20:42,098
you can still get the item corresponding
to that child view controller

373
00:20:42,098 --> 00:20:47,187
and then you can set the properties just
like he did in the other case

374
00:20:48,087 --> 00:20:51,088
now let's look at with your controller
and no surprise that

375
00:20:51,097 --> 00:20:54,175
turns out to be very parallel ass but
the controller has an area

376
00:20:55,075 --> 00:20:59,081
but you items which point to their view
controllers to create it you do the item

377
00:21:00,035 --> 00:21:01,066
you're added are you create

378
00:21:01,066 --> 00:21:04,113
at the child you controller got it ok

379
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:08,090
mary Fallin now we have some methods
from you control a presentation

380
00:21:08,009 --> 00:21:10,108
if you wanna do your own manual
presentation rather than going through

381
00:21:11,089 --> 00:21:12,110
segways

382
00:21:13,001 --> 00:21:16,006
I you can present two controllers sheep
you can Controller

383
00:21:16,015 --> 00:21:19,094
you can present it as a model window or
the popover you can also of course

384
00:21:19,094 --> 00:21:21,097
dismiss you controllers

385
00:21:22,024 --> 00:21:25,065
you can transitions between your
controllers with this method here

386
00:21:25,065 --> 00:21:28,067
options give you the trend to how you
wanna transition

387
00:21:28,067 --> 00:21:31,148
a one-goal tip their options let you go
I'm

388
00:21:32,048 --> 00:21:35,075
flied left or right you can also choose
to slide

389
00:21:35,075 --> 00:21:38,874
forward or backward which is a much more
international Saudi way of doing it

390
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:40,500
because an art

391
00:21:40,005 --> 00:21:43,008
at the right to left language it will go
the a

392
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:46,094
go the other way which is appropriate
for that for the users

393
00:21:46,094 --> 00:21:50,953
you why we also have methods which will
be familiar

394
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:55,070
to you from my OS method that let you
see i

395
00:21:55,007 --> 00:21:58,029
for

396
00:21:58,029 --> 00:22:01,115
thank I got to talk about this first I
gotta say

397
00:22:02,015 --> 00:22:06,026
2008 Buell appear and then the like and
also met to find out when my outlook

398
00:22:06,026 --> 00:22:09,110
you're so pretty straightforward stuff
and a good addition to the class

399
00:22:10,001 --> 00:22:14,024
I one more thing about you controller is
that it's now automatically added

400
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:20,040
into the responder chaim car there you
go

401
00:22:20,004 --> 00:22:23,046
I have and again let me just show a
picture and then trying to read those

402
00:22:23,082 --> 00:22:24,159
two bollocks here's your view

403
00:22:25,059 --> 00:22:27,154
here's a responder chain you have your
parent use all the way up to the windows

404
00:22:28,054 --> 00:22:30,079
you control are you up child abuse
pointing

405
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:33,176
at the view and view controller with
sorta hang around in the side

406
00:22:34,076 --> 00:22:38,084
you know not part of that whole group
there on out part of that group

407
00:22:38,084 --> 00:22:42,053
not that we tried doing this for all out
and we ran into responder chain cycle

408
00:22:42,809 --> 00:22:46,330
not a good idea so this happens that
this changes affect the only perhaps

409
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:48,059
building if the 1010 SPK

410
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:51,104
let me now talk a about

411
00:22:52,004 --> 00:22:55,012
something a little different API
modernization

412
00:22:55,012 --> 00:22:59,037
now they're been many a bath in
objective-c or in recent years

413
00:22:59,037 --> 00:23:02,121
a for instance at property that's been
around for a while now

414
00:23:03,021 --> 00:23:06,058
instance type enough to text with
underlying types

415
00:23:06,058 --> 00:23:11,066
NS require super and a new one because
added and after the gate and a slider

416
00:23:11,066 --> 00:23:13,148
that lets you identified as need
initializer

417
00:23:14,048 --> 00:23:18,497
and then 1010 and I was a testy case we
made a concerted

418
00:23:18,929 --> 00:23:24,630
effort to adopt these and a lot more are
PPI

419
00:23:24,063 --> 00:23:27,161
and why are we doing this well-being
allow

420
00:23:28,061 --> 00:23:31,150
up to state the API's more precisely
more correctly

421
00:23:32,005 --> 00:23:35,100
and that of course has many benefits
API's are now more self documenting you

422
00:23:36,045 --> 00:23:39,061
don't have to go to the documentation
that much it's much clearer right there

423
00:23:39,061 --> 00:23:40,630
in the other file one API does

424
00:23:41,179 --> 00:23:45,700
it allowed API to be more consistent you
don't ever ask the question now why is

425
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:47,052
this a property in this other thing that
looks very much like it

426
00:23:48,015 --> 00:23:52,038
not a property it allow pics go to be
more helpful

427
00:23:52,038 --> 00:23:56,071
you now get much better context since
the completion from some cases

428
00:23:56,071 --> 00:23:59,280
it allows the composite enable the
compiler to

429
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,880
our Warren and a it did detect and
warned about potential bugs and this is

430
00:24:03,088 --> 00:24:06,887
really a big win I mean it will really
find some errors

431
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,470
and out last but not least that allows
better exposure or API

432
00:24:11,047 --> 00:24:14,116
and swept a script for instance has a
stricter definition

433
00:24:15,016 --> 00:24:19,024
for the up property is and by declaring
the properties experts will be in

434
00:24:19,096 --> 00:24:20,177
objective-c we allowed them to be
exposed

435
00:24:21,077 --> 00:24:25,163
properly and sweat as well

436
00:24:26,063 --> 00:24:30,135
now one a consequence of all this is
that as you build your applications

437
00:24:31,035 --> 00:24:34,102
against the new st. case you may see new
warnings and errors in your bill

438
00:24:35,002 --> 00:24:38,027
please pay attention to them because
some of them might actually be potential

439
00:24:38,027 --> 00:24:41,073
a real bugs lurking around in your code

440
00:24:41,073 --> 00:24:45,112
K I wanna just talk a bit about one of
these areas here and that's the at

441
00:24:46,012 --> 00:24:48,033
property change:

442
00:24:48,033 --> 00:24:51,112
now we converted many accessors many
getter setter pairs and getters not if

443
00:24:52,012 --> 00:24:54,071
the ice to at property

444
00:24:54,071 --> 00:24:57,145
and obvious ones for instance if you
look at as control the target property

445
00:24:58,045 --> 00:24:59,097
in object Valley property are now

446
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:02,676
real property you must at the target
property is weak I'm gonna talk about

447
00:25:03,549 --> 00:25:05,640
that in a second

448
00:25:05,064 --> 00:25:09,070
but we also conducted what are computed
properties or possibly Computer

449
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:09,062
Properties

450
00:25:10,025 --> 00:25:13,069
at property fourth integer value in
string value enough

451
00:25:13,069 --> 00:25:17,136
control might be computed of object
value property but we don't want to

452
00:25:18,036 --> 00:25:19,235
expose that

453
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:23,910
implementation detail in our API so we
make them all into poverty

454
00:25:23,091 --> 00:25:27,095
no you don't care as the API consumer
another thing we commend the property is

455
00:25:27,095 --> 00:25:29,103
something like this corruption which is
obvious the computer

456
00:25:30,075 --> 00:25:33,082
every kind called it's going to generate
the description but that's also a good

457
00:25:34,045 --> 00:25:38,524
property we believe and we made it into
a proper

458
00:25:38,929 --> 00:25:42,028
so use property for anything up about
the value our state on object or its

459
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:44,690
relationship to other objects

460
00:25:44,069 --> 00:25:48,308
so then you might be wondering what is
not a property

461
00:25:48,929 --> 00:25:53,140
well okay not every method which can be
expressed as a property should be

462
00:25:53,014 --> 00:25:56,089
not every method but looks like a
property should be not sometimes but

463
00:25:56,089 --> 00:25:57,091
looks like a duck

464
00:25:58,009 --> 00:26:02,044
it's not a doc the canonical example is
the retain method you know the good ol

465
00:26:02,044 --> 00:26:04,109
became method for those of you still
remember what that is

466
00:26:05,009 --> 00:26:09,026
I'll it returns a value it takes no
arguments looks like a getter

467
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:12,035
but it's not a doc neither on a property

468
00:26:12,035 --> 00:26:15,076
either so what are our some example

469
00:26:15,076 --> 00:26:19,138
of bad can it with her back and it's for
a property

470
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:23,107
so methods which do things such as load
part and particle

471
00:26:24,007 --> 00:26:27,032
these might return like apart state they
might turn a result they might turn a

472
00:26:27,032 --> 00:26:27,101
bully and

473
00:26:28,001 --> 00:26:31,044
and they might pick no arguments but
they're not properties you can usually

474
00:26:31,044 --> 00:26:33,052
recognize these car they have a burr
prefix

475
00:26:33,052 --> 00:26:37,100
on the name generators like in it not
that cocky about that some of these also

476
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,095
at the first rule of course or object
enumerator these guys

477
00:26:41,095 --> 00:26:44,314
are returning your result every time
they're not returning

478
00:26:45,169 --> 00:26:49,160
values that I results that are I'd
important meaning the same every time so

479
00:26:49,016 --> 00:26:51,109
they're not good candidates for
properties

480
00:26:52,009 --> 00:26:55,077
another category is method which change
state such as next object

481
00:26:55,077 --> 00:26:59,116
not a good another attended for part B
as well

482
00:27:00,016 --> 00:27:03,089
we have to make sure the methods also
swim like a duck and quacks like a duck

483
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:05,093
before you make up the property

484
00:27:06,029 --> 00:27:09,088
not earlier you saw week property on
enough on the target

485
00:27:09,088 --> 00:27:13,093
probably be I'm we use the rowing week
for target now

486
00:27:14,038 --> 00:27:17,827
that the cleared with the week actually
on the target now to see what effect the

487
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:21,190
only an application to link against the
1010 STK

488
00:27:21,019 --> 00:27:24,046
up preview for other applications that
thing binaries

489
00:27:24,046 --> 00:27:27,265
targets still have the a fine behavior

490
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,684
now we're also using week for delegates
and data sources

491
00:27:31,179 --> 00:27:34,280
moving forward new API's front of your
the new API we add

492
00:27:34,028 --> 00:27:37,071
this relief however we're not changing
the existing delegate and datasource

493
00:27:37,071 --> 00:27:38,083
methods

494
00:27:38,083 --> 00:27:43,132
to use we properties there's too many
compatible considerations for that one

495
00:27:44,032 --> 00:27:48,048
now as I said we've done these in our
API's but you can also modernize your

496
00:27:48,048 --> 00:27:48,133
code as well

497
00:27:49,033 --> 00:27:52,110
if you'd like into good idea because it
might help you find bugs in your code

498
00:27:53,001 --> 00:27:54,088
and you get the benefit type shown

499
00:27:54,097 --> 00:27:58,173
the convert the modern objective-c them
pack mod a

500
00:27:59,073 --> 00:28:02,148
refactoring tool which is actually next
go today has been augmented

501
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:06,132
to do so the to do thought these changes
as well

502
00:28:07,032 --> 00:28:10,271
ICANN fee outcome of them in the a panel
you get

503
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,620
and you can choose which ones you and do
and go ahead and do them now one word of

504
00:28:14,169 --> 00:28:15,233
warning though

505
00:28:15,809 --> 00:28:19,760
I'm this tool doesn't do all the changes
it also

506
00:28:19,076 --> 00:28:22,089
may not get everything right point that
might not get the exact

507
00:28:22,089 --> 00:28:25,878
type of property right so you really
need to review the

508
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:29,730
the changes offered up by the school and
I

509
00:28:29,073 --> 00:28:34,081
accept them or tweet them as needed

510
00:28:35,053 --> 00:28:38,061
the next I'm not talk about swept now
they're lot of questions about swept

511
00:28:39,033 --> 00:28:42,122
so I'm not gonna go into any language
details or anything else about try to

512
00:28:43,022 --> 00:28:43,089
teach you certain

513
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:46,124
anything like that so I'm I hope you'll
be able to go to go sessions and enjoy

514
00:28:47,024 --> 00:28:47,083
does

515
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:52,110
I'm said I'm just gonna talk to
basically about the API attractions

516
00:28:53,001 --> 00:28:55,007
within the context of cocoa and Cocoa
Touch

517
00:28:55,016 --> 00:28:59,165
Swift is the new language for cocoa and
provide seamless interoperability with

518
00:28:59,309 --> 00:29:04,520
the cocoa API's and of course a
objective-c code

519
00:29:04,052 --> 00:29:07,083
now as you know API is a API design is

520
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:10,091
a near and dear to our hearts I

521
00:29:10,091 --> 00:29:13,850
given a few AP I'd find talking about so
we think deeply about

522
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:18,100
API consideration

523
00:29:18,001 --> 00:29:22,089
and existing API guidelines we have in
cocoa for objective-c

524
00:29:22,098 --> 00:29:26,417
pretty much applied uswest as well and
with just one exception but I'll talk

525
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:28,850
about later dinette methods

526
00:29:28,085 --> 00:29:31,146
there's really no changes in API as
their exposed

527
00:29:32,046 --> 00:29:35,101
in swept now this doesn't mean of course
as we

528
00:29:36,001 --> 00:29:40,002
out start adopting more apps which
features in our API

529
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:43,019
more API's forward not be taking
advantage of something new and exciting

530
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:45,108
features apps with objective-c does not
offer

531
00:29:46,008 --> 00:29:50,071
so we're gonna be doing up over time of
course

532
00:29:50,071 --> 00:29:53,116
so just let me just show you how some
cocoa AP I've come across in sweat

533
00:29:54,016 --> 00:29:57,165
first properties there's a pretty
obvious one

534
00:29:57,309 --> 00:30:02,345
at the and that's wrecked a at the frame
propagandist you typed as an abstract

535
00:30:02,669 --> 00:30:06,210
be straightforward here's how it looks
like in sweat

536
00:30:06,021 --> 00:30:09,069
now as I'm showing the fight if you have
a comp is a lot which lines objective-c

537
00:30:09,069 --> 00:30:12,071
which line the swift just look for the
lack of semicolon

538
00:30:12,071 --> 00:30:15,075
that identified the sweat line there's
another one

539
00:30:15,075 --> 00:30:18,078
storyboard property of of an issue
controller

540
00:30:18,078 --> 00:30:22,084
here's what looks like in swept note the
exclamation mark there on the storyboard

541
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:25,087
which indicates that the property of
this could be no

542
00:30:25,087 --> 00:30:28,149
and to get which indicate that this is a
read-only property

543
00:30:29,049 --> 00:30:32,086
and here's one more case the sub use
property of %uh

544
00:30:32,086 --> 00:30:35,182
an SRA which is of course declared as an
SRA in objective-c

545
00:30:36,082 --> 00:30:39,116
which implicitly means an SRA of ID

546
00:30:40,016 --> 00:30:44,114
it comes across the swift as an array of
any object for any object is the

547
00:30:45,014 --> 00:30:49,088
counterpart I D not just want to refine
what I'm talking about as we move

548
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:49,187
forward

549
00:30:50,087 --> 00:30:53,182
you wanna declared API better because we
this is really an area and this

550
00:30:54,082 --> 00:30:57,941
use of course right now this is not
coming through the API

551
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:01,830
here but its refinement but we'd like to
do here and other places and more

552
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:01,169
importantly

553
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:05,101
as you define your own API since work
within your programs you take advantage

554
00:31:06,001 --> 00:31:06,086
of sweat

555
00:31:06,086 --> 00:31:09,101
unique features to express your program

556
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:13,009
better

557
00:31:13,009 --> 00:31:17,013
now let me show you some mapping of
methods point method with no arguments

558
00:31:17,013 --> 00:31:20,039
there's a simple case display if needed
here's what looks like an

559
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:23,068
swept and here's what the call looks
like in swept

560
00:31:23,419 --> 00:31:27,370
display need it with open poster and at
the end to indicate that this is a

561
00:31:27,037 --> 00:31:29,049
method called pretty straightforward

562
00:31:29,049 --> 00:31:32,148
there's a method with one argument

563
00:31:33,048 --> 00:31:36,070
and at some you method

564
00:31:36,007 --> 00:31:39,726
here's what it looks like in sweat now
nope this a view here

565
00:31:40,419 --> 00:31:44,431
and one thing to note is that this a
view colon is not a label

566
00:31:44,539 --> 00:31:48,590
the name of this method does add sup you
this a view is simply that name of the

567
00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:48,146
variable

568
00:31:49,046 --> 00:31:53,255
the name of the local variable for that
argument existing objective-c Heather

569
00:31:53,669 --> 00:31:58,140
making its way into the swift interface
here so really there method signature of

570
00:31:58,014 --> 00:32:00,048
this method is at sub you and it takes
an in-depth

571
00:32:00,048 --> 00:32:03,060
you calling something like this is

572
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:07,955
again also pretty straightforward at sup
you and and your arguments right there

573
00:32:08,549 --> 00:32:12,500
now let's look at the are case with
multiple arguments

574
00:32:12,005 --> 00:32:16,013
there's a new method performs take what
identifiers that take a Segway ID and a

575
00:32:16,058 --> 00:32:19,065
Fender

576
00:32:19,065 --> 00:32:22,132
the first part name goes outside the car
and and then any

577
00:32:23,032 --> 00:32:27,121
labels for second and further arguments
go inside the parent like this

578
00:32:28,021 --> 00:32:32,110
not that the Segway ID is again the
variable name for the local argument

579
00:32:32,299 --> 00:32:36,335
that up goes there and the fender goes
right there with the fender sis

580
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:39,723
that label and argument name are the
same a swift collapse

581
00:32:40,299 --> 00:32:43,700
them for you into one it doesn't repeat
the word sender so note that in this

582
00:32:43,007 --> 00:32:44,099
case the Segway ideas not

583
00:32:45,062 --> 00:32:48,851
part of than it's on the label it's not
part of the name of the method but the

584
00:32:49,409 --> 00:32:50,380
fender is

585
00:32:50,038 --> 00:32:53,124
so really the method signature for this
is performed segment I don't fire

586
00:32:54,024 --> 00:32:59,085
extreme argument and then senator Colin
twitches and in the object argument

587
00:32:59,085 --> 00:33:04,150
an indication of this is pretty
straightforward as you can see here

588
00:33:05,005 --> 00:33:08,164
so Coco API so many experts that label
on the first argument

589
00:33:08,659 --> 00:33:14,080
we saw that with the I'm with their
example from the previous slide

590
00:33:14,008 --> 00:33:17,032
here's another example points this is
how you call a delegate methods but you

591
00:33:17,032 --> 00:33:18,511
can collapse up to you

592
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:22,280
it works very well the first part of the
name includes the

593
00:33:22,028 --> 00:33:26,090
the type of the first argument and other
labels described other arguments

594
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:29,018
here's another example with three
argument that resource value values the

595
00:33:29,909 --> 00:33:32,830
first argument and four key and error
explicit labels

596
00:33:32,083 --> 00:33:36,150
on the subsequent arguments this results
in natural method mean for their easy to

597
00:33:37,005 --> 00:33:37,794
read

598
00:33:38,289 --> 00:33:43,990
easy to speak and easy to really crap as
redeveloping API

599
00:33:43,099 --> 00:33:46,187
now you might be thinking when to use
when should you consider labels on the

600
00:33:47,087 --> 00:33:48,094
first time in because swift will

601
00:33:49,057 --> 00:33:52,152
RR you to put labels on the first
argument methodName it's just not the

602
00:33:53,052 --> 00:33:55,069
default behavior

603
00:33:55,069 --> 00:33:58,071
up one cases where argument technique we
weighed

604
00:33:58,071 --> 00:34:01,170
subpart so the whole funds but the other
method called moved to XY

605
00:34:02,007 --> 00:34:06,009
in swept it would come across like this
and may be worth a look so good

606
00:34:06,072 --> 00:34:09,211
wide extruded what somewhat differently
than why

607
00:34:09,859 --> 00:34:12,862
you might consider method names like
this

608
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:15,931
and is actually the kind of structure
you will see increased and free-form

609
00:34:16,309 --> 00:34:17,343
functions in sweat

610
00:34:17,649 --> 00:34:21,667
where you have the ability to put labels
on argument

611
00:34:21,829 --> 00:34:24,858
but it's better in these cases the store
to think about if these are all

612
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:28,125
equally weights apart for the whole is
there some combo type that represents

613
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:28,724
them

614
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:32,282
force in this case the CG point on and
this point there are many other benefits

615
00:34:32,849 --> 00:34:35,888
to using a combo type you're not
shopping all the arguments all over the

616
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:36,940
place

617
00:34:36,094 --> 00:34:40,803
also a using a comp combined single type
is a more promising approach the API

618
00:34:41,649 --> 00:34:44,710
guidance pathfinder arguments one by one
you're specifying this one

619
00:34:45,259 --> 00:34:48,336
whole thing to represent them and you
know we have many other types to

620
00:34:49,029 --> 00:34:51,126
represent combine types an estate in a
state components

621
00:34:51,999 --> 00:34:56,051
I'm you I collar and a scholar and a
strange CD rack we have a new FB and

622
00:34:56,519 --> 00:34:57,578
vector three types represent

623
00:34:58,109 --> 00:35:02,170
points and 3d space and so on so now you
such types where appropriate and the

624
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:06,751
you get rid of this problem now earlier
I mentioned it methods

625
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:13,039
it methods I are an exception to the
label thing it's another case

626
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:17,094
that the to the rule with the about the
first argument here than it with frame

627
00:35:17,589 --> 00:35:20,596
in objective-c here's how it comes
across

628
00:35:21,289 --> 00:35:24,293
in threat again frame here

629
00:35:24,329 --> 00:35:27,422
is a label and the way you call this

630
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:33,460
is in a few throw the constructor syntax
initializer syntax with the frame

631
00:35:33,046 --> 00:35:34,065
argument at the label

632
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:37,934
in this case save now we see in the
sense of the code you read and

633
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:42,390
and flight yesterday

634
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:45,978
and there's the fear the frame label now
communis constructors

635
00:35:46,329 --> 00:35:50,331
I'm as you know in objective-c we've had
initializer Zenit methods

636
00:35:50,529 --> 00:35:53,537
we also have what we call these
constructor method like this one and a

637
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:54,150
scholar

638
00:35:54,015 --> 00:35:58,039
color but pattern image and these were
just another way to say that method

639
00:35:58,039 --> 00:35:59,042
except you don't have to call

640
00:35:59,042 --> 00:36:02,096
out lock and the communion affect
stripped

641
00:36:02,096 --> 00:36:05,455
recognize these patterns it in fact it

642
00:36:06,319 --> 00:36:10,336
I'm it reflects that as an initializer
method just like this so swift

643
00:36:10,489 --> 00:36:12,900
recognizes that this method is really in
it

644
00:36:12,009 --> 00:36:15,688
with a pattern image argument so this
actually comes across in sweat

645
00:36:16,579 --> 00:36:20,160
just like initializer does will actually
great because it simplifies

646
00:36:20,016 --> 00:36:24,675
that dichotomy between companies
constructors and magnet methods

647
00:36:24,819 --> 00:36:28,140
I let me talk about one more thing about
API I'm

648
00:36:28,014 --> 00:36:32,088
induct in MI two types because this one
is really really pretty cool

649
00:36:32,088 --> 00:36:36,717
here's a new I you know we've added
recently a few releases ago

650
00:36:37,509 --> 00:36:40,606
might come format account style note
that it's got four values but it's so

651
00:36:41,479 --> 00:36:42,515
hard to figure out

652
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:45,878
what's different about those for now
they are these not long words which are

653
00:36:46,229 --> 00:36:47,630
night in this trip there but

654
00:36:47,063 --> 00:36:50,422
it sorta like what's going on there
here's what this looks like and sweat

655
00:36:50,989 --> 00:36:54,190
it's really like breath of fresh air
like while you know if I'll

656
00:36:54,019 --> 00:36:57,928
memory death more by Andrea really cool
and you think is really pretty neat to

657
00:36:58,099 --> 00:36:58,700
hear that

658
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:02,176
you know I am up to call it you might
say and its by come from other counts

659
00:37:02,869 --> 00:37:03,440
style

660
00:37:03,044 --> 00:37:06,141
not file however in context where the
argument type is known

661
00:37:07,041 --> 00:37:10,046
you really just after you stop file and
you know I can fit that

662
00:37:10,091 --> 00:37:13,145
bulletin to one line and Val improve our
slides moving forward

663
00:37:14,045 --> 00:37:17,141
its people that

664
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:21,250
thanks

665
00:37:21,619 --> 00:37:24,660
so let's talk about gesture recognizers
which is a known you a prob added

666
00:37:25,029 --> 00:37:29,670
in and again a few gesture recognizers
on IRC this is Artus will feel familiar

667
00:37:29,067 --> 00:37:30,476
to you

668
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:34,700
gesture recognizers allow you to
eliminate large chunks of code

669
00:37:34,007 --> 00:37:38,636
by doing there mouse tracking for you
and just generating an action at the end

670
00:37:39,329 --> 00:37:40,334
for the appropriate texture

671
00:37:40,829 --> 00:37:44,831
it also i helped disintegrate between
various types of quicksand drags it

672
00:37:44,849 --> 00:37:48,670
might sometimes be hard to figure out
there's a new class gesture recognizer

673
00:37:48,067 --> 00:37:52,143
it's got five apartment and you can also
create your own subclasses because we

674
00:37:53,043 --> 00:37:55,352
provide API that specifically

675
00:37:55,739 --> 00:37:58,801
designed for supply thing that gesture
recognizer

676
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,423
there's gonna be more about gesture
recognizers at the storyboards and

677
00:38:01,999 --> 00:38:03,053
controllers talk which is

678
00:38:03,539 --> 00:38:08,544
this afternoon at 4:30 now if you want
to deal with events yourself

679
00:38:08,589 --> 00:38:12,380
ordeal with other kinds of events other
than mouse events there's a block-based

680
00:38:12,038 --> 00:38:16,527
event tracking API this also helps
eliminate a lot of code by taking over

681
00:38:16,869 --> 00:38:16,962
that

682
00:38:17,799 --> 00:38:21,170
new that you might are often have to
ride this a

683
00:38:21,017 --> 00:38:24,146
whips let me show you that I think there
you go so this

684
00:38:24,299 --> 00:38:27,324
I'm to lobby the path the math
governmental interest in a time out and

685
00:38:27,549 --> 00:38:28,420
there's a block up

686
00:38:28,042 --> 00:38:31,114
called ended the tracking will continue
until your

687
00:38:32,014 --> 00:38:39,014
Telep stop or the timeout timeout with
the key

688
00:38:40,007 --> 00:38:43,019
in

689
00:38:43,082 --> 00:38:46,091
we have some new accessibility API the
new API's are

690
00:38:46,091 --> 00:38:52,091
simpler their express tax bill p-values
exploit the values for various Rylance

691
00:38:52,091 --> 00:38:53,096
and you I i'm

692
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:59,042
properties are expressed directly as
property there's no need to subclass

693
00:38:59,051 --> 00:39:02,140
in bogus umbria some review the old API

694
00:39:03,004 --> 00:39:06,010
and I bear bear a compile-time warnings
as well because they're now

695
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,007
actual property is being used here let
me give you an example

696
00:39:10,007 --> 00:39:14,046
before you had this acceptable catchment
value method which you had to override

697
00:39:14,109 --> 00:39:16,260
any other theories if statements to deal
with it

698
00:39:16,026 --> 00:39:19,094
now you can either just going to
override acceptable P label method

699
00:39:19,094 --> 00:39:22,102
fairly straightforward I can actually
affect the property as well if you're

700
00:39:23,002 --> 00:39:24,004
not supply from there

701
00:39:24,022 --> 00:39:27,099
apart from that class for other reasons
so know much cleaner

702
00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:31,128
much cleaner approach let me talk a bit
about power and

703
00:39:32,028 --> 00:39:36,043
count on my power the kind of power that
comes out of a wall clock it but

704
00:39:36,043 --> 00:39:39,094
even that kinda even with that kind of
power comes great responsibility

705
00:39:39,094 --> 00:39:44,097
because you need to use it wisely new
API we've added across the system

706
00:39:45,024 --> 00:39:48,393
in a number of class and cocoa is this
concept of quality of service

707
00:39:48,609 --> 00:39:52,890
it finance operation at operation Q&A
thread and so on

708
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:56,097
this allows indicating the nature and
importance of the work

709
00:39:56,097 --> 00:39:59,171
you're doing in lets us to manage
resources

710
00:40:00,071 --> 00:40:03,127
between your processing across processes
are possible

711
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:09,080
let me talk about what the values of
this quality of service property

712
00:40:09,008 --> 00:40:14,797
are I'll just go through use cases for
it the first one user interactive is an

713
00:40:15,589 --> 00:40:17,430
interactive session with the user

714
00:40:17,043 --> 00:40:21,068
such as a drawing program or maybe
scrolling and human email message you

715
00:40:21,068 --> 00:40:23,129
really want 60 frames per second there

716
00:40:24,029 --> 00:40:28,858
for the user and up that represents that
kinda work the next hour later here

717
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:33,220
user initiated is like when the user
clicks email message they want to appear

718
00:40:33,022 --> 00:40:36,911
there very quickly but maybe don't have
the same 60 pips continuous behavior

719
00:40:37,109 --> 00:40:40,730
all these wanna get no whatever is
possible to get that to happen as

720
00:40:40,073 --> 00:40:41,094
quickly as possible

721
00:40:41,094 --> 00:40:45,253
you to a PR quality of services
something like periodic male patch these

722
00:40:46,099 --> 00:40:49,530
are expected to happen expected to
happen fast on a regular basis

723
00:40:49,053 --> 00:40:52,122
but you know can be off by a few seconds
if the system is busy with other things

724
00:40:53,022 --> 00:40:56,050
we have a background quality of service
which is like indexing

725
00:40:56,005 --> 00:40:59,009
which needs to happen but could be
delayed if they're more important things

726
00:40:59,054 --> 00:40:59,119
happening

727
00:41:00,019 --> 00:41:03,072
and then the default which allows the
quality of service

728
00:41:03,072 --> 00:41:07,074
be inferred from other operations are
going on sometimes you might have a

729
00:41:07,092 --> 00:41:09,105
dependent operation that will dictate

730
00:41:10,005 --> 00:41:13,030
what the resulting what the resulting
quality of service here

731
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:17,061
is we also have a new API nuke what's
called a nice background activity

732
00:41:17,088 --> 00:41:21,557
scheduler this is basically a coke a
little interface XPC activity API

733
00:41:22,349 --> 00:41:25,354
mythological schedule maintenance or
background

734
00:41:25,849 --> 00:41:29,930
kinda path for instance periodic picking
up mail or maybe I

735
00:41:29,093 --> 00:41:33,155
indexing and so on you can provide again
quality of service that you want on this

736
00:41:34,055 --> 00:41:37,067
this operation we have a number of talks
about power

737
00:41:37,067 --> 00:41:40,746
here's pointers to to a bomb ones
tomorrow morning riding energy efficient

738
00:41:41,349 --> 00:41:42,351
code part 1

739
00:41:42,369 --> 00:41:45,690
there's also a part 2 as well that can
go to after this one if you want

740
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:49,117
and powerful from for diagnostics what's
new in GCB annex PC and thats Thursday

741
00:41:50,017 --> 00:41:51,018
afternoon at cue

742
00:41:51,027 --> 00:41:54,045
I'll let me talk a

743
00:41:54,045 --> 00:41:58,081
to you a bit about in a string we have a
new API

744
00:41:58,081 --> 00:42:02,166
in a string encoding detector this is to
allow

745
00:42:03,066 --> 00:42:06,485
detecting encodings of random back to
bite

746
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:10,080
which come from who knows where

747
00:42:10,089 --> 00:42:13,810
who knows where they've been but you
need to show it to the user and

748
00:42:13,081 --> 00:42:17,380
typically we r encodings up there some
bad characters in there are other bad be

749
00:42:18,109 --> 00:42:21,270
generated or corrupt along the way it
becomes pretty hard to make heads or

750
00:42:21,027 --> 00:42:23,068
tails out and that's what the PPI tries
to do

751
00:42:23,068 --> 00:42:28,165
you have number options a among the
options are debited specify which in

752
00:42:29,065 --> 00:42:30,484
coatings to include

753
00:42:31,069 --> 00:42:34,750
consider for sure which including to
exclude taking give hand

754
00:42:34,075 --> 00:42:37,122
to make the operation more focused you
can

755
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:41,641
tell us whether you want lofty
conversion or not if

756
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:45,310
including conversion is not possible
without loss

757
00:42:45,031 --> 00:42:49,050
well just do it anyway and maybe some
characters are lost and finally

758
00:42:49,329 --> 00:42:52,280
not finally this is just another option
can provide a language came to which

759
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:53,119
allows day including conversion

760
00:42:54,019 --> 00:42:57,115
to again focus more that knows what
language that encoding is intended to be

761
00:42:58,015 --> 00:42:59,098
in

762
00:42:59,098 --> 00:43:04,115
we have to you small new API's contained
in string in Lok life cases contain

763
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:05,069
string

764
00:43:05,069 --> 00:43:08,498
might be thinking you mean though these
right there well they were you know you

765
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:10,460
could use range of string

766
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:13,140
but after some years we decided you know
even though these are just one

767
00:43:14,004 --> 00:43:19,088
whiners even

768
00:43:20,024 --> 00:43:23,077
thank you even though these are
one-liners and you know that's right to

769
00:43:23,077 --> 00:43:24,099
append the API

770
00:43:24,099 --> 00:43:27,106
sensibility of why create a one-line
communion they're really good

771
00:43:28,069 --> 00:43:31,145
for discover bill T you know campaign
string at the lawn or this Carlton

772
00:43:32,045 --> 00:43:35,101
range of strings up here we have them
okay

773
00:43:36,001 --> 00:43:39,004
the one other thing on the talking about
that this might impact your abscess

774
00:43:39,031 --> 00:43:40,580
tagged pointer strings

775
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:44,730
what we do here is we take a hole in a
string object and we

776
00:43:44,073 --> 00:43:47,082
stop it into the base pointer and
something roller dealing with some

777
00:43:48,063 --> 00:43:50,150
objects like enough numbers and the
state and now we're doing a banana

778
00:43:51,005 --> 00:43:52,057
strings as well

779
00:43:53,002 --> 00:43:56,095
let me give you a visual guide of how
this works here you're creating a utf8

780
00:43:56,095 --> 00:43:58,744
string

781
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,960
typically you have your object pointer
base pointer which is

782
00:44:02,096 --> 00:44:06,181
the a pointer and that in turn points to
an object which contains the is up plus

783
00:44:07,081 --> 00:44:10,152
some bookkeeping information and then
the bites of the string

784
00:44:11,052 --> 00:44:14,131
so just a call that and we shove it just
like that

785
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:17,601
into the base pointer and you saw how
that works and

786
00:44:17,619 --> 00:44:20,880
no we don't need for the pointer anymore
so being a real point you're so now in

787
00:44:20,088 --> 00:44:21,547
that 64 bits we have

788
00:44:22,339 --> 00:44:26,410
the bolstering up with along with some
it but keeping information

789
00:44:26,041 --> 00:44:29,102
now turns out we can do this for about
25 to 40 40 percent of your strings in

790
00:44:30,002 --> 00:44:31,801
some applications

791
00:44:31,819 --> 00:44:35,180
there are some things to watch for
there's no is a pointer

792
00:44:35,018 --> 00:44:38,020
now you aren't supposed to be acting as
a pointer but if you were you will

793
00:44:38,038 --> 00:44:39,767
really crash right now

794
00:44:40,109 --> 00:44:44,170
in their different performance
characteristics some operations get much

795
00:44:44,017 --> 00:44:45,052
faster and some get

796
00:44:45,052 --> 00:44:49,093
low-floor and they're better out of
bounds checking

797
00:44:49,093 --> 00:44:52,762
we've make sure that these can do much
better outta bounds checking we try to

798
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:56,600
get outta bounds checking but there are
some cases where the math and actually

799
00:44:56,609 --> 00:44:57,810
does a better job

800
00:44:57,081 --> 00:45:00,360
since all of these three are potential
compatibility concerns

801
00:45:01,089 --> 00:45:05,200
we actually make it so that this changes
enabled for 1010 link

802
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:10,026
ap or later but not earlier aP's and of
course only 46 for the haps

803
00:45:10,044 --> 00:45:14,133
cuz trying to shovel them to a 3-pointer
it was not fun

804
00:45:15,033 --> 00:45:18,562
let me talk a bit about for matters and
here we have I

805
00:45:18,859 --> 00:45:22,700
but when you format your classes in this
format a classis

806
00:45:22,007 --> 00:45:26,014
the first three are fairly
straightforward mas por matter

807
00:45:26,077 --> 00:45:30,123
energy for matter and length for matter

808
00:45:31,023 --> 00:45:34,912
we also have a date in trouble for
matter that we should take two dates and

809
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:38,400
show you that a

810
00:45:38,004 --> 00:45:41,083
thank you and a date components for
matter which Walden

811
00:45:42,019 --> 00:45:46,448
show you a duration for three hours 25

812
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:49,666
an Arby's have some various
customization options for slot

813
00:45:50,089 --> 00:45:57,089
last one could be customized say know
about 10 minutes remaining

814
00:45:58,077 --> 00:46:01,926
and now note that these are for
formatting only not for parsing

815
00:46:02,619 --> 00:46:06,010
so it's for output of beta

816
00:46:06,001 --> 00:46:09,025
in we have a form and context

817
00:46:09,025 --> 00:46:12,884
property on all are and as for matters

818
00:46:13,109 --> 00:46:17,290
and here's what looks like and I'll DEF
explain to you what some of these are

819
00:46:17,029 --> 00:46:20,117
for what form and context does that tell
the formatter where the result of the

820
00:46:21,017 --> 00:46:21,102
formatting

821
00:46:22,002 --> 00:46:26,051
is intended to be used and that allows
it to give a different result

822
00:46:26,069 --> 00:46:29,790
where possible went with if your arm

823
00:46:29,079 --> 00:46:32,118
formatting date in French

824
00:46:33,018 --> 00:46:36,042
beginning of a sentence would look like
this June with a capital J

825
00:46:36,042 --> 00:46:39,991
while the middle of a sentence would use
a Little J now this dynamic here one is

826
00:46:40,369 --> 00:46:40,437
pretty cool

827
00:46:41,049 --> 00:46:47,420
because what it does is depending on
about the result is used

828
00:46:47,042 --> 00:46:50,921
in the context of in a string formatting
depending on whether to use at the

829
00:46:51,299 --> 00:46:53,450
beginning of a sentence middle of a
sentence or

830
00:46:53,045 --> 00:46:56,073
found along it will use one of the other
three options to do the right thing

831
00:46:56,073 --> 00:46:59,148
such downs usually the one you want to
use on the you definitely know whatever

832
00:47:00,048 --> 00:47:03,053
the result is going

833
00:47:03,053 --> 00:47:06,148
there the internationalization talked
this morning if you missed it

834
00:47:07,048 --> 00:47:10,122
you can't action on video of course let
me talk a bit about

835
00:47:11,022 --> 00:47:14,911
I cloud and you heard about I card
yesterday of course

836
00:47:15,109 --> 00:47:19,380
we have new API the clock at API with
the new framework for managing structure

837
00:47:19,038 --> 00:47:20,070
they don't i cloud

838
00:47:20,007 --> 00:47:23,051
in for sharing such data between users
as well

839
00:47:24,014 --> 00:47:27,108
and clout it was also as an
implementation detail the back

840
00:47:28,008 --> 00:47:33,019
and the for I clarke document storage as
well

841
00:47:33,019 --> 00:47:36,056
I'm not gonna talk about pocket anymore
other than just telling you there too

842
00:47:36,056 --> 00:47:40,065
great sessions you can go to this
afternoon and Thursday afternoon

843
00:47:40,569 --> 00:47:44,490
now iPod document storage as you know i
ka documents or just something we've had

844
00:47:44,049 --> 00:47:50,052
for a while and this document and you I
document provides support for it

845
00:47:50,052 --> 00:47:53,077
so having you back and in the form of
cloud kid

846
00:47:53,077 --> 00:47:56,083
and we also another feature a document
versions are now available

847
00:47:56,083 --> 00:48:01,116
on I clout in addition you heard about I
call drive yesterday where

848
00:48:02,016 --> 00:48:05,017
all applications can now read and write
files from

849
00:48:05,026 --> 00:48:10,113
I clout thanks to die Cloud Drive as
well

850
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:15,017
now in the moving to the new back and

851
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:18,100
and taking advantages up some of these
other changes some of the

852
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,599
way we work but I car documents has
changed

853
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:26,020
now course abusing us document in you I
document

854
00:48:26,002 --> 00:48:29,038
perhaps you don't have to worry about
these perhaps you do

855
00:48:29,038 --> 00:48:32,131
handling of noun downloaded files has
changed previously there'd be a file

856
00:48:33,031 --> 00:48:35,117
with the same name as the Nano the
document

857
00:48:36,017 --> 00:48:40,166
and we just fell in overtime now such
files are tracked with invisible filed

858
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:41,650
with different names

859
00:48:41,065 --> 00:48:44,024
if you're using AP of such as Medicare
Quarrymen today the item pile

860
00:48:44,609 --> 00:48:46,680
coordinator you're probably in good
shape and you probably won't have to

861
00:48:47,319 --> 00:48:48,310
worry about this

862
00:48:48,031 --> 00:48:51,056
but you're a new meeting I called
contain yourself

863
00:48:51,056 --> 00:48:54,595
you need to I'm ignore hidden or
unrecognized files

864
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:58,470
but better yet just switch to one of
these other API if you can

865
00:48:58,047 --> 00:49:01,119
higher level the better we'll talk some
APIs URL

866
00:49:02,019 --> 00:49:05,063
that allow you to get meta data for
possibly

867
00:49:05,063 --> 00:49:09,302
undone loud and downloaded element and
this is like get promised item resource

868
00:49:09,869 --> 00:49:11,130
value for thier

869
00:49:11,013 --> 00:49:15,054
there are few other method like this as
well

870
00:49:15,054 --> 00:49:18,098
I just a quick job update on core data

871
00:49:18,098 --> 00:49:22,101
we have a number of new API's in core
data and that's backed up data quest

872
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:27,096
a lousy new batch updates and at
actually pretty cool and on

873
00:49:27,096 --> 00:49:29,158
you know small memory striations that's
what you can do a lot of updates

874
00:49:30,058 --> 00:49:31,567
efficiently

875
00:49:32,089 --> 00:49:35,115
and efficient inspector crest is a new
class for doing a few

876
00:49:35,349 --> 00:49:39,400
inspecting it provides a nice progress
support which allows you to

877
00:49:39,004 --> 00:49:43,703
I'm monitor progress and also in fact
cancelled operation as well

878
00:49:44,099 --> 00:49:47,160
and finally of course it's worth
mentioning that the new back and fry

879
00:49:47,016 --> 00:49:48,039
clout

880
00:49:48,039 --> 00:49:51,123
is I is also up underneath core data as
well

881
00:49:52,023 --> 00:49:55,862
so there's infrastructure improvements
we do have a related session what's new

882
00:49:56,069 --> 00:49:59,090
in court it up Thursday morning

883
00:49:59,279 --> 00:50:03,660
I'll or layout you have some we've been
improving our way out all along are

884
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:03,133
allowed in

885
00:50:04,033 --> 00:50:08,542
remains a very important I'm a that's
all pnr frameworks both

886
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:14,260
I'm on Iowa and North Penn we have some
you APIC I'm just can't talk about it

887
00:50:14,026 --> 00:50:18,125
poom these arm allow you to activate and
a flat-out constraints directly as you

888
00:50:19,025 --> 00:50:22,079
might know a way out constrain has
pointed to the views that its

889
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:26,152
um the defining a relationship or
surrounded and talking to their

890
00:50:27,052 --> 00:50:31,138
views you cannot talk layout constraints
directly to activate and deactivate them

891
00:50:32,038 --> 00:50:35,757
which is a much Queen our model so what
this means is that these three methods

892
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:36,175
here at

893
00:50:36,859 --> 00:50:43,859
the two methods put the property replace
these for existing methods effectively

894
00:50:44,018 --> 00:50:47,083
NFL is on its way to form a deprecation
I think we've been saying this for a few

895
00:50:47,083 --> 00:50:48,097
years now

896
00:50:48,097 --> 00:50:51,183
a I'm it Phillips

897
00:50:52,083 --> 00:50:56,127
I so some enough LAPI have been promoted
to their corresponding control for

898
00:50:57,027 --> 00:50:57,121
classes

899
00:50:58,021 --> 00:51:01,023
and so you should use the controls where
possible

900
00:51:01,041 --> 00:51:05,054
no don't use self control now have the
API's hopefully and you can refer to

901
00:51:05,054 --> 00:51:06,118
them

902
00:51:07,018 --> 00:51:10,137
and i felt basic cable you has been
deprecated use the view-based

903
00:51:10,299 --> 00:51:13,330
table view that also allows you to get
to my new the new features will be in

904
00:51:13,609 --> 00:51:15,626
showing you with new look and so on much
more

905
00:51:15,779 --> 00:51:20,210
you going enough metric space and this
browser is deprecated use the item based

906
00:51:20,021 --> 00:51:21,106
on this browser API's

907
00:51:22,006 --> 00:51:25,555
and its major convulsants way out since
its so Anna cell-based

908
00:51:25,609 --> 00:51:30,400
I'm 1 one of the most common uses
brightness matrixes was of course that

909
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:33,032
radio button behavior very quick one in
all the others turned off

910
00:51:33,068 --> 00:51:37,113
now sibling radio buttons with the same
action will now operate as a group

911
00:51:38,013 --> 00:51:43,452
so this is a way to get at matrix
functionality without using make

912
00:51:43,569 --> 00:51:46,730
okay I'm gonna go quickly threw out some
other news

913
00:51:46,073 --> 00:51:52,074
stall you can slowed us down when you
watch the video Q&A catch more about it

914
00:51:52,074 --> 00:51:56,863
I am sign up table %um out my music and
creepy statically now if you have a pic

915
00:51:57,529 --> 00:51:59,561
stable you would like five rows and

916
00:51:59,849 --> 00:52:02,750
don't do anything else you don't wanna
provide data source you can do that now

917
00:52:02,075 --> 00:52:03,141
there's a way to do it

918
00:52:04,041 --> 00:52:07,096
and if the mitchell out in space by
passing Reseda reciting behaviors you

919
00:52:07,096 --> 00:52:08,147
can specify cap insert

920
00:52:09,047 --> 00:52:12,049
you can I'm also specify resizing out
and you can also

921
00:52:12,049 --> 00:52:16,158
you such enough images as math for
additional affect you fun

922
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:19,626
forget and as bitmap image wrapped
allied

923
00:52:19,869 --> 00:52:23,917
specify I'm Indian this and other bitmap
format so you can actually sport

924
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:28,220
BGR a data friends and

925
00:52:28,022 --> 00:52:31,621
if you're into that sort of thing and
after catalogs

926
00:52:31,819 --> 00:52:36,930
have in Xcode now sport more of formats
like JPG images

927
00:52:36,093 --> 00:52:40,022
and up yeltsin also are you could just
fly thing and the use of course the

928
00:52:40,859 --> 00:52:45,860
estimates captain said API to expose
that flight information

929
00:52:45,869 --> 00:52:49,810
you can do later prospects affect the
tributes ring

930
00:52:49,081 --> 00:52:52,156
popovers now how much is your way to
detach you don't have to worry about

931
00:52:53,056 --> 00:52:54,083
paying the rent or whatever

932
00:52:54,083 --> 00:52:58,168
just responses delegate method combo box
datepicker pop up button search your

933
00:52:59,068 --> 00:53:00,507
pants but you know all too

934
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:05,121
right to left properly and will let and
you might as the user might expect

935
00:53:05,319 --> 00:53:08,950
and so you don't have to worry about

936
00:53:08,095 --> 00:53:12,114
no bloating have a new API to do custom
set up in your view subclass

937
00:53:13,014 --> 00:53:16,038
for live use sport and Interface Builder
to just

938
00:53:16,038 --> 00:53:19,081
to use in context Interface Builder if
you wanna do something custom

939
00:53:19,081 --> 00:53:24,082
while for debugging purposes OpenGL
context you can now carry some property

940
00:53:24,091 --> 00:53:26,170
so you don't have to go down to the CDL
context

941
00:53:27,007 --> 00:53:31,056
file coordinator has a methods for a
sickness waiting

942
00:53:32,019 --> 00:53:35,072
so rather than having to all these
methods on your own background cues you

943
00:53:35,072 --> 00:53:37,171
let the file coordinator create and
manage the queues for you

944
00:53:38,071 --> 00:53:42,096
so much better way to do this and its
workspace have methods

945
00:53:42,096 --> 00:53:45,125
as your opening your alls you can now
specify exactly which

946
00:53:46,025 --> 00:53:49,073
ap you want to be used

947
00:53:49,073 --> 00:53:53,124
NS Euro also have a lot of new API's one
for instance while I it's result Ilyas

948
00:53:54,024 --> 00:53:54,075
file

949
00:53:54,075 --> 00:53:57,091
with this you I'll buy you something
else alias file

950
00:53:57,091 --> 00:54:02,183
if you are okay and we have our last few
and this process info has methods to get

951
00:54:03,083 --> 00:54:05,129
the operating system version and can be
operating system

952
00:54:06,029 --> 00:54:10,083
version comparisons a few months and and
a fix PC Connection of sport enough

953
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:10,174
progress part

954
00:54:11,074 --> 00:54:15,113
across processes which actually is a
pretty cool feature as well

955
00:54:16,013 --> 00:54:19,074
okay so no more pictures of food cuz
we're done

956
00:54:19,074 --> 00:54:23,079
a here are the things we talked about
many exciting features some of these are

957
00:54:24,024 --> 00:54:25,092
free from not

958

now as you go down to lunch I expect you
to try to adopt these in your

959
00:54:29,006 --> 00:54:33,008
