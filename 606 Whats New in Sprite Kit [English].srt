1
00:00:11,028 --> 00:00:16,047
low my name's Norman I like to give you
a quick tour

2
00:00:16,047 --> 00:00:20,123
does on what's new in spike it so last
year we have announced break it

3
00:00:21,023 --> 00:00:25,282
at a conference a high-performance 2d
game engine with building physics

4
00:00:25,489 --> 00:00:26,060
support

5
00:00:26,006 --> 00:00:30,007
we also built walls writings have axe
call to help developing improved their

6
00:00:30,007 --> 00:00:30,080
in common

7
00:00:30,008 --> 00:00:34,071
you to recent I'm like the particle
editor and automatic pactor outlets

8
00:00:35,043 --> 00:00:38,100
generator and this year women's bracket
even better

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,097
we have awesome graphics technologies
like cedars

10
00:00:42,097 --> 00:00:45,162
lighting their shadows the help you
really bring all the liveliness of your

11
00:00:46,062 --> 00:00:46,501
game

12
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:51,100
we also have good simulation
technologies like per pixel physics

13
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:51,530
closure

14
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:55,030
physics feel in risk animatics and
constraints

15
00:00:55,003 --> 00:00:59,952
I really allow you to build reach user
interactions so that's not all

16
00:00:59,979 --> 00:01:03,004
UNESCO sex really is we now have a spiky

17
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:06,520
editor billion to the ides that allow
you to create

18
00:01:06,052 --> 00:01:10,081
game scenes with a rating any cold I can
use the very same

19
00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:15,320
editor to give iraq with any of the new
and existing spray kit features

20
00:01:15,032 --> 00:01:20,123
talk with that so for the adapter for
the study session we're gonna start

21
00:01:21,023 --> 00:01:23,100
looking at Hull to use custom satyrs to

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,074
customize the drawing behaviors of your
sprite how to add light English saddles

23
00:01:28,074 --> 00:01:28,165
to your scene

24
00:01:29,065 --> 00:01:32,112
and we have a lot on your physics update
I like to give your

25
00:01:33,012 --> 00:01:36,045
update on and the uruguay show a scene
kid really bring

26
00:01:36,045 --> 00:01:41,058
new possibility of writing to the games
he also blurs the lines between

27
00:01:41,058 --> 00:01:45,065
the actual 20-game a three-game
implementations colossally I'm going to

28
00:01:46,028 --> 00:01:47,047
give you a quick tour

29
00:01:47,047 --> 00:01:50,053
and demo of the new spec editor and

30
00:01:50,053 --> 00:01:53,114
some old improvement already existing
ATI's

31
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:57,083
so the first thing i wanna talk about a
shade urs

32
00:01:57,083 --> 00:02:01,104
spray kit does a fantastic job of
distracting

33
00:02:02,004 --> 00:02:06,053
the lower level platform peep and
graphics API is away from our users

34
00:02:06,053 --> 00:02:09,069
but from time to time does this always

35
00:02:09,069 --> 00:02:12,143
a very special effect the one achieve
see a custom Bloor

36
00:02:13,043 --> 00:02:18,087
or a you keep the signature win a trough
or movies and the

37
00:02:18,087 --> 00:02:21,126
the posse fact or when you build a space
game

38
00:02:22,026 --> 00:02:25,069
where the space ship it taking a damn
and you want to have a custom were being

39
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:25,125
a factor

40
00:02:26,025 --> 00:02:30,594
on a sprite cedars become a more
relevant solution in this case

41
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:36,700
and for this release we do give you the
ability so here we have a spectator time

42
00:02:36,007 --> 00:02:36,039
all

43
00:02:37,002 --> 00:02:41,040
we actually does run during a single
sprite without any pictures up but it

44
00:02:41,004 --> 00:02:43,059
just but despite itself is running a
commentator's

45
00:02:43,095 --> 00:02:46,143
so the sooner does a lot of things here
is running all the stars in the

46
00:02:47,043 --> 00:02:51,322
background is also drawing the grade of
Applied working in fact off the grid

47
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:55,620
and also when the tax use user part is
any of the screen

48
00:02:55,062 --> 00:02:58,140
areas as gonna provide a and the fact
solved is

49
00:02:59,004 --> 00:03:02,065
a dong initiators too so to do this we
also passing

50
00:03:03,001 --> 00:03:07,079
the actual touch locations topple the
Cedars uniform so initiator

51
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:10,170
Cedar Knolls okay you there just touch
this area now let's run to the working

52
00:03:11,007 --> 00:03:11,075
here

53
00:03:12,038 --> 00:03:17,086
i render the energy fact associated with
it so let's have a look at what overview

54
00:03:17,086 --> 00:03:18,105
of a shaker look like

55
00:03:19,005 --> 00:03:23,006
so seder hope you're really caught my
eye the way to spice it wrong

56
00:03:23,015 --> 00:03:26,112
you have a hundred percent control of
whole every single pixels are gonna be

57
00:03:27,012 --> 00:03:28,019
all put on the screen

58
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:32,073
the seders impact use a very few like
to. SL syntax

59
00:03:32,073 --> 00:03:36,100
and they are very powerful tool to have
any of the the powerful you fact

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,489
image processing or to all the way to
fast motion blurs that the

61
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:45,620
that's been using 3d games I whether you
are new to strike at

62
00:03:45,062 --> 00:03:49,106
or existing spiky users you can drop
this custom scenery and with just a

63
00:03:50,006 --> 00:03:50,105
single line of code

64
00:03:51,005 --> 00:03:54,017
sought to use custom cheaters

65
00:03:54,017 --> 00:03:58,051
we create a brand new object SK cedar
object it is actually a cop a nod to

66
00:03:58,051 --> 00:03:59,110
hold the G all

67
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:03,597
at all open Dr yes fragments later so
we're falling 30 0 SL

68
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:07,040
doping di oh yes 2.0 standard and

69
00:04:07,004 --> 00:04:10,203
the ones here I to say they can be
deployed to both always 10

70
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,560
I'll ask so heroes are the list of a

71
00:04:13,056 --> 00:04:16,635
know that's being supported and Spike it
so as case right now support custom

72
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:17,650
traders

73
00:04:17,065 --> 00:04:20,294
ask a shape note now support custom
cedar samples

74
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:23,967
drawing the stalking and failing and
ASCII middle

75
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:28,020
so with the particle the fact you have a
custom changer

76
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:31,002
run the art every single you made a
particles in a scene

77
00:04:31,002 --> 00:04:35,033
colossally the fact know to ask AC now
support custom cheaters

78
00:04:35,033 --> 00:04:39,034
so that gives you the powerful ability
to not only use the sky filters

79
00:04:39,043 --> 00:04:43,129
to have a force manufact but also you
have a sea turtle have any possible

80
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:48,087
in fact that you want to implement so a
source the Cedars getting uploaded to

81
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:50,153
the sprite is being run at the pixel
level

82
00:04:51,053 --> 00:04:54,110
we also passing a lotta building
actually feels to a seder so you'll have

83
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:55,092
to

84
00:04:56,001 --> 00:04:59,053
set up a brand new attribute our
uniforms and pass it in

85
00:04:59,053 --> 00:05:02,087
so for example here we're passing that
you texture they give it to you as

86
00:05:02,087 --> 00:05:05,144
what actors being used for the current
sprite as well as well as well as that

87
00:05:06,044 --> 00:05:07,063
packs a cornet

88
00:05:07,063 --> 00:05:11,158
and the size of the sprite that scene
pixel size

89
00:05:12,058 --> 00:05:15,079
so hard to say to work in sprite kept
once you have

90
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:18,103
you know about after Taylor Potts now
eight

91
00:05:19,003 --> 00:05:23,047
has to possible actual bills that you
can start of the first one is the Cedar

92
00:05:23,047 --> 00:05:23,124
source

93
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:27,041
you can create a share from two
possibilities by attacking the source

94
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:31,100
why is creating the Seder from a a file
and also you can

95
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,054
said the Seder from us track & Touche to
resolve also have a

96
00:05:36,054 --> 00:05:40,107
are real uniforms these optional by the
if you're shade or actually requires any

97
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,029
of the external parameters that being
said

98
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:46,105
your game you can use at ASCII uniforms

99
00:05:47,005 --> 00:05:51,060
on the uniforms property so now once we
have the school property set

100
00:05:51,006 --> 00:05:55,010
the Seder is loaded and is ready to go

101
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,001
and we have a saying here for example SE
has three separate sprites

102
00:06:00,001 --> 00:06:03,630
you cannot find a satyr directly to the
scene you can I find

103
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:07,754
at the Cedar to any of the sprite and
the pick up the fact right away

104
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:11,985
in an xterm in an extreme

105
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:15,350
so create a seder will have the new API
I S case a dirty cash

106
00:06:15,035 --> 00:06:19,694
cray with the file esposito was found
name way passing like blurred a FSH

107
00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:24,037
by Seder is actually look like energy
opened OpenGL fragment program that has

108
00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:25,305
a main function

109
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:29,300
I in the return value seventy of red
collar and it was a tourney than any

110
00:06:29,003 --> 00:06:30,342
other custom uniforms

111
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,050
you can just set uniforms are a here we
creating I ski uniform uniform

112
00:06:35,005 --> 00:06:38,124
I with name you give it a name here we
call you read

113
00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:42,840
that's a floating type and the next one
we setting are your tax /url passing in

114
00:06:42,084 --> 00:06:43,162
a sec the second retexture

115
00:06:44,062 --> 00:06:48,581
to the concentrator so the supported
types are float

116
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:52,400
taxer back to two three or four and
matrix

117
00:06:52,004 --> 00:06:56,803
to buy 2303 and format for

118
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,030
and for the full list of the Customs and
Border were passing into the Seder %uh

119
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,062
soon as you see there is getting run

120
00:07:02,062 --> 00:07:05,155
here's the full list so in from the
uniform you get direct access to this

121
00:07:06,055 --> 00:07:10,056
to the texture of the sprite the Spry
sizing from in pixels

122
00:07:10,056 --> 00:07:13,155
the global time and continue to any
other animation from the callers are

123
00:07:14,055 --> 00:07:15,144
shaped

124
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:19,750
and you also have access if you're have
custom cedar that's running on a shape

125
00:07:19,075 --> 00:07:22,584
to the ship path land in terms of
varying

126
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:26,660
we passing the tax for cornet the color
makes

127
00:07:26,066 --> 00:07:31,075
as well as the distance of the path and
we also have a very company a method in

128
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:33,590
a satyr so you can call directly

129
00:07:33,059 --> 00:07:36,118
call escapee for sharing this is as if

130
00:07:37,018 --> 00:07:40,044
you work let's break it to run their to
current sprite

131
00:07:40,044 --> 00:07:43,053
and gimme the pixel value

132
00:07:43,053 --> 00:07:46,058
of the car behavior

133
00:07:46,058 --> 00:07:50,063
so the shooters are cool there some best
practices I like to call out

134
00:07:50,063 --> 00:07:53,065
so number one I like to recommended
using

135
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:57,422
believe uniforms as much as possible so
we do passing a law to you too far for

136
00:07:58,169 --> 00:08:00,030
you to use that gives you a lot of

137
00:08:00,003 --> 00:08:03,078
raw at abuse of what we draw what we
doing at the open to: level

138
00:08:03,078 --> 00:08:06,159
but if you do need to access all the
same uniforms

139
00:08:07,059 --> 00:08:10,698
please use their building 12 minimized
the moderate honesty

140
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:16,530
and also or would reckon man to avoid
changing the status or so

141
00:08:16,053 --> 00:08:20,074
in a maid of a frame because there were
four such a to recompile Asian happening

142
00:08:20,074 --> 00:08:23,813
at a backhand also when the Cedars being
loaded

143
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:29,020
and you will recommend to loss at all
the uniforms Apr on

144
00:08:29,002 --> 00:08:32,151
and you can change uniforms every frame
that's nice and fast

145
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:37,241
but adding or removing uniform also
called another Cedar Creek a politician

146
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:41,930
also in terms of drawl call performance
would like to share

147
00:08:41,093 --> 00:08:44,099
the same same shade or yes there's as
much as possible because

148
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:47,185
the same say they're running our
monopole drawing yes there's gas to back

149
00:08:48,085 --> 00:08:49,804
together

150
00:08:50,569 --> 00:08:54,730
and will recommend to initial I the
Seder a long time

151
00:08:54,073 --> 00:08:57,432
and unify the shade or using a file name
rather than

152
00:08:58,089 --> 00:09:02,098
initial I say they're using string
because if the satyrs are

153
00:09:02,179 --> 00:09:05,211
model traders are sharing the same
shooter source as practical pick it up

154
00:09:05,499 --> 00:09:06,100
as a

155
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:10,460
a identical satyrs ok top at Dhaka
batting performers

156
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:15,110
will remain high so the summary of using
custom satyrs

157
00:09:15,011 --> 00:09:18,023
allow you to completely customize the
way sprite

158
00:09:18,023 --> 00:09:21,105
are being rendered on screen you have
brought access to a lot of the building

159
00:09:22,005 --> 00:09:22,072
actually feels

160
00:09:22,072 --> 00:09:25,131
that we're passing dow arm to the Seder

161
00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:29,600
and he could create even a number of
kuwait uniquely fax for a game

162
00:09:29,006 --> 00:09:33,031
next I wanna talk about lighting sash
adults

163
00:09:33,085 --> 00:09:37,304
so lightings eyeshadows really play all
the liveliness of your game say if I'm

164
00:09:38,069 --> 00:09:41,111
building a Dodgers game I'm walking in
the long corridor

165
00:09:41,489 --> 00:09:45,517
all of Southern the area gets dark and
all is an ICA

166
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:48,825
at very p.m. a shaky light at the end of
the hallway that kinda

167
00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:55,332
bring out that really scary atmosphere
and mood for a player

168
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:58,706
so too cradle I'd in spike at we
introduce

169
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,417
a new pipe cut XK light note you can

170
00:10:02,579 --> 00:10:05,646
added to see you and position to
anywhere you want

171
00:10:06,249 --> 00:10:09,300
and they can apply to any of the spray
that's being participated

172
00:10:09,003 --> 00:10:12,022
in the car light you can change the
color

173
00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:15,368
shadow a fall of all the light and with
support

174
00:10:15,809 --> 00:10:19,856
up to having 8 life like for singles
right

175
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:24,331
and the bottom line is SK light no they
just another as keynote

176
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:27,875
you can move it around parent it when
another sprite if you want to lie to

177
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:29,624
follow wanna be a sprite

178
00:10:30,209 --> 00:10:35,213
you can write actions on it have a trial
for all paths

179
00:10:35,249 --> 00:10:38,342
is really cool so now let's look at some
other basic

180
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:42,223
at properties for SK like an old so here
we have a scene

181
00:10:42,619 --> 00:10:46,658
it's very bland we at a light source in
a scene

182
00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:50,078
now if we can't into the light colored
if it's a bit like a lot to be yellow

183
00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:53,790
as a yellow camp to the collect collar

184
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:57,058
and now if we set a shadow color to be
gray

185
00:10:57,769 --> 00:11:01,110
and now the boxes star casting shadows

186
00:11:01,011 --> 00:11:04,016
and lastly if we wanna see a little bit
more of the scene

187
00:11:04,061 --> 00:11:07,210
with seven Indian caller to really bring
in a sea of op

188
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:11,766
a little bit more so let's look at the
Addison your actually feels for ask a

189
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:11,892
line on

190
00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:16,475
number one follow-up fall of controls
the the radius of the light

191
00:11:16,619 --> 00:11:21,660
in bed in terms are be at the fact and
with also picked what works really well

192
00:11:21,066 --> 00:11:22,595
with our physics

193
00:11:23,189 --> 00:11:26,194
properties with the category B masks so
with sprite

194
00:11:26,689 --> 00:11:30,707
note now you have individual big control
of whether the sprite is participating

195
00:11:30,869 --> 00:11:31,790
in the lining

196
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:34,110
whether it's casting shadows or whether
it's receiving channels

197
00:11:35,001 --> 00:11:38,027
you high-flying control of exactly how
you want to control these three

198
00:11:38,036 --> 00:11:38,875
attributes

199
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:42,231
for each individual sprite

200
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:45,588
and now it seems we're talking about
spread out sprain old also have a brand

201
00:11:46,209 --> 00:11:50,660
new property called normal pack sure
which you can I find all attacks or Web

202
00:11:50,066 --> 00:11:54,165
so usually normal character is were
happily using 3d games

203
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:58,790
and not what actor accused the pixel RGB
a value to describe what a normal factor

204
00:11:59,069 --> 00:11:59,077
for the services

205
00:11:59,869 --> 00:12:03,730
on it works so the lighting calculation
can be can be used up all with the

206
00:12:03,073 --> 00:12:03,552
normal

207
00:12:04,209 --> 00:12:07,288
factors so here we using the exact same
for Miller

208
00:12:07,999 --> 00:12:12,290
so to render the scene with a normal map

209
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:16,308
we use the traditional a plot be equal
see for Miller which means you supplied

210
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,596
the picture

211
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,790
supplied a normal catcher strike a chord
with magic

212
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:24,998
and gave you the result which is
lighting up the scene where

213
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:28,726
with the bumpy service that's being
mapped so here you

214
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:32,917
you as you can see I kinda sad normal
Patrick directly on a ask a sprite note

215
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:38,170
by loading at from the normal top PNG
file

216
00:12:38,017 --> 00:12:41,054
to now be in spy kids: we like to make
oral

217
00:12:41,054 --> 00:12:45,122
users live as easy as possible so in
addition to the a plot see

218
00:12:46,022 --> 00:12:50,022
be equal see for Miller we get your
directly from able see

219
00:12:50,022 --> 00:12:54,621
you do not need to supply and any normal
map so all we do is we take the source

220
00:12:54,819 --> 00:12:58,970
packs for image a perform image analyze
Asian

221
00:12:58,097 --> 00:13:01,206
on every single pixel one based on the
premise of each pixel

222
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,420
we have a multi-pass ok with them that
generate the best

223
00:13:05,042 --> 00:13:08,051
normal map that describe the current
picture

224
00:13:08,429 --> 00:13:12,475
so if you give us a picture that you
take from the beach was part of

225
00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:15,968
rocks in the air rounded ads is really
sharp

226
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:21,692
yet the surf Israel remain very small so
here is very easy is magic one-liner

227
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:24,893
all we need to do a just sprite nah
attacker be called

228
00:13:25,649 --> 00:13:32,649
generate a normal map from the existing
sprite picture

229
00:13:36,239 --> 00:13:40,410
that's not all there's not a solution

230
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:43,380
or a one-size-fits-all solution so

231
00:13:43,749 --> 00:13:47,540
e-edition would provide two more
problems for you guys to change the

232
00:13:47,054 --> 00:13:50,073
dynamic behavior of the generate a
normal map

233
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:53,621
in from los mas mas in terms of contrast
which is whole

234
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:59,100
Pompey you wanna may surface to be and
this will give in combination give you

235
00:13:59,001 --> 00:14:02,063
if in a number of lockhart for example
or cops tall

236
00:14:02,072 --> 00:14:07,031
I just have to call for help running on
these two primers with 1 second delay

237
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:10,688
as you can see he actually change the
look you can get if in a number looks

238
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:11,647
all over

239
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:15,292
and the best part about automatic normal
map generation is

240
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:19,658
you can't do this on dynamic content if
you to take a picture from

241
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:23,321
all side and decide to put her in a game
guess what you can't light it without

242
00:14:23,699 --> 00:14:24,717
any normal taxer

243
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:28,881
we can't do they all orders for you

244
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:32,948
so to summarize lighting and shadows
they are very easy to use

245
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:36,475
as K Line Road is just like any askin
all the camera animation on a

246
00:14:37,249 --> 00:14:38,264
comparative

247
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,970
you can set up collars and everything is
a one-liner automatic normal map

248
00:14:42,097 --> 00:14:46,366
generation really provide is dynamic
look for you you don't have to span

249
00:14:47,239 --> 00:14:50,302
time sitting down with art isn't trying
to figure out how to hi I'm paying them

250
00:14:50,869 --> 00:14:50,877
normal map

251
00:14:51,669 --> 00:14:54,761
always purple facing all were dark grey
facing to the left

252
00:14:55,589 --> 00:14:58,610
you don't have to do any of that we
would take over the nitty gritty detail

253
00:14:58,799 --> 00:14:58,878
for you

254
00:14:59,589 --> 00:15:03,637
either some best for practice in terms
of performance I like to play now

255
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:07,136
it's okay to have multiple light in a
scene under runs reasonably fast

256
00:15:07,739 --> 00:15:10,745
but if have the number of flights

257
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:13,850
that's riding the very same sprite
actually matters

258
00:15:13,085 --> 00:15:16,116
and you have more than two lights
lighting the same sprite

259
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:21,355
you mice not be able to stay our cost is
$60 on certain I O S on mars

260
00:15:21,499 --> 00:15:25,507
just something to pop point out

261
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:29,582
Nexus I like to point out all the new
physics features that we have so that's

262
00:15:29,609 --> 00:15:30,790
a look at them

263
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,038
number one per pixel physics updates we
have a

264
00:15:34,749 --> 00:15:37,792
constraints allowed on remove the
boilerplate code

265
00:15:38,179 --> 00:15:41,248
your updates we also have inverse
kinematics allowed to

266
00:15:41,869 --> 00:15:45,895
field biomechanical way I we also have
physics field that

267
00:15:46,129 --> 00:15:50,214
applied his forces are allowed to build
the next space game simulation

268
00:15:50,979 --> 00:15:53,983
so let's look at the perfect offices
body creation

269
00:15:54,379 --> 00:15:57,474
with the current implementation on the
left side if I wanna

270
00:15:58,329 --> 00:16:01,338
build it cures game I kept

271
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:04,436
the best thing I can do is using parking
circles

272
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:08,592
I create the bombing circle are on these
boxes the skiers

273
00:16:08,619 --> 00:16:11,674
they will actually quite each other and
appeared only in Turlock

274
00:16:12,169 --> 00:16:16,100
okay maybe I configure the late a bit I
reduce the reviews on the fifth his body

275
00:16:16,001 --> 00:16:16,780
for the

276
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:19,892
to keep my overlap but they still don't

277
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:23,061
toxic exactly and also the but the

278
00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:26,565
the angular velocity don't transfer from
one cure to another

279
00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:29,957
but now with a single line of code you
can generate from

280
00:16:30,569 --> 00:16:33,970
go from there too give you a physics

281
00:16:33,097 --> 00:16:36,446
I up pics pixel-based fit his body

282
00:16:37,319 --> 00:16:40,368
it's very easy some

283
00:16:40,809 --> 00:16:43,880
so will your trust back the source
cement a base on the alpha mask

284
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:49,040
we generate iraq shape and based on the
shape we generate exact shape that's the

285
00:16:49,004 --> 00:16:49,783
minimum all

286
00:16:49,819 --> 00:16:52,832
yell to fade occurrence right it's very
accurate

287
00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:56,043
and now the bill gears them all you can
just have a couple one-liners

288
00:16:56,889 --> 00:17:00,953
have the same code in there just changed
from using bombing sarcos to using

289
00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:04,571
image-based his body and the you are
good to go and they can be

290
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:09,022
can't they can be transferring an
interlocking it's really fun

291
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,760
so let's look at how we do it so

292
00:17:12,076 --> 00:17:16,102
with the curry PI to create a fitness
body you with the bombing box

293
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:22,071
visit was busy body and the body with
rectangle of size would give you our

294
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:25,620
exact on the box of the dimension that
you have specified

295
00:17:25,062 --> 00:17:29,251
now with the new API as the same
initializer coming in

296
00:17:29,809 --> 00:17:33,450
instead you just passing the texture on
the size of the texture

297
00:17:33,045 --> 00:17:36,874
for example a hammer here we give you
the exact camera body that tree through

298
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,352
the all I you no longer have to

299
00:17:39,009 --> 00:17:45,084
do that yourself or title bill any
opossum Mason on the faces body

300
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:48,788
just like the automatic a normal map
generation there's not a one solution

301
00:17:49,049 --> 00:17:49,820
fits all

302
00:17:49,082 --> 00:17:53,801
if you have a source are the has a lot
of semi transparent pixels

303
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:57,612
we do allow despised by the of us finds
of a threshold

304
00:17:58,269 --> 00:18:02,331
which defines which part pixels being
interpolated during the process as a pic

305
00:18:02,889 --> 00:18:05,891
or not

306
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:08,944
so in some rain per pixel fit his body

307
00:18:09,259 --> 00:18:13,830
is read very easy to create and they're
very accurate

308
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:17,087
add whether you are existing spiky users
are new to

309
00:18:18,023 --> 00:18:22,094
the API's it's just a matter of setting
one line change

310
00:18:22,094 --> 00:18:25,333
you're a code to create really actor
physics simulations

311
00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:29,830
so again like to point out the
performance tips

312
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:32,402
spike it does a really good job
optimizing this algorithm

313
00:18:33,149 --> 00:18:37,330
I we provide a good balance between
performance at accuracy

314
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:42,111
by the picture size matters so you if
you are passing year a2k by 2k taxer

315
00:18:43,011 --> 00:18:46,024
ask you live down to 10 percent
rendering

316
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:50,843
a twenty by two hundred by two hundred
sprite we do have to walk down the hall

317
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:52,490
to kept by 2k pics

318
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:55,075
pixels in order to figure out the exact
shape

319
00:18:55,075 --> 00:18:59,082
I so just something to think about

320
00:19:00,045 --> 00:19:04,394
next a brand new API the cost range to
help you

321
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,886
really a simplified a game up the logic

322
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:11,674
the country and motivational training
cost reprises to really im removed a

323
00:19:12,169 --> 00:19:13,120
boilerplate

324
00:19:13,012 --> 00:19:17,441
cold in your update so a lot of times I
wanna move a character

325
00:19:17,549 --> 00:19:21,700
but I want healthy indicator to follow
the character that exactly five pixels a

326
00:19:21,007 --> 00:19:21,012
ball

327
00:19:22,002 --> 00:19:26,014
to pick those behind I need to put the
end of the summer

328
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:29,111
and you have a camera you wanna Auriemma
can learn the following airplane

329
00:19:30,011 --> 00:19:34,011
guess what I need to add a cold and to
calculate the angle and

330
00:19:34,011 --> 00:19:37,690
figure out the Delta translated bit of a
rotation as a translation

331
00:19:37,789 --> 00:19:41,940
or the airplane wanna land on a runway
and you don't worry in that first

332
00:19:41,094 --> 00:19:48,053
we do all that work for you can with do
it with simple contract

333
00:19:48,899 --> 00:19:51,963
so now we add because the cost rain is
being added

334
00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:56,220
we need to add some new features in our
update loop

335
00:19:56,022 --> 00:19:59,821
so in up little expanded to some new
selectors

336
00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:03,190
number one right after physics
simulation now

337
00:20:03,019 --> 00:20:06,058
the scene start kicking in the
constraint soul customers are not

338
00:20:06,058 --> 00:20:06,867
limited asx:

339
00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:10,730
to physics anymore so you don't have to
worry about all with the character

340
00:20:10,073 --> 00:20:13,134
expanding on a conveyor belt is gonna be
pushed over

341
00:20:14,034 --> 00:20:17,121
because the box is right beside it
constraint take care of that for you

342
00:20:18,021 --> 00:20:22,050
and right after class rank update user
have another chance public

343
00:20:22,005 --> 00:20:26,284
doing another update we do gave use or
call back up did apply ka strain

344
00:20:26,779 --> 00:20:32,806
so here you have a chance to do any
other last-minute cleanup

345
00:20:33,049 --> 00:20:37,100
and the bases and constraints again have
a new object to ask a cost rain object

346
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:40,617
and is used to wrap around this
mathematical cost rain on the properties

347
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:43,240
of the know the one enemy

348
00:20:43,024 --> 00:20:47,085
so the cost rains at their attached a
note via the new cars trains

349
00:20:47,085 --> 00:20:50,144
RA and the scene will apply the cost
rains

350
00:20:50,909 --> 00:20:55,910
to the attacks no so what kinda
construct an effect on a note

351
00:20:56,009 --> 00:20:59,750
you can set cost rate composition or an
tation

352
00:20:59,075 --> 00:21:04,724
and distance and can quickly able and
disabled between frames

353
00:21:05,399 --> 00:21:08,980
so for example it will go quick example
of Bob Holt who

354
00:21:08,098 --> 00:21:12,107
Korean to note cost frameworks so we
just call ask a constraint with

355
00:21:13,007 --> 00:21:14,856
Warrington old initializer

356
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:18,340
and follow a note so here DA rotors for

357
00:21:18,034 --> 00:21:21,097
following the circle and we're just
passing the circle yes nevertheless

358
00:21:21,097 --> 00:21:22,026
keynote

359
00:21:22,899 --> 00:21:27,230
and the reins of Saturday's 0 and you
can send I wanna leave the circle

360
00:21:27,023 --> 00:21:28,202
following and/or

361
00:21:28,409 --> 00:21:31,410
lacking at you have that possibility

362
00:21:31,419 --> 00:21:34,508
so once the cost rain is created i jus
directly soccer sat on the air earth

363
00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:39,345
arm cost ranch property

364
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:44,681
next call to reset positional constraint
so here we create a personal rains up

365
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:47,825
far minus a hundred to a hundred we can
first

366
00:21:48,149 --> 00:21:53,190
set the limit of constrained on the
x-axis this will limit the moment

367
00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:58,378
in the x-direction of the No now we can
also sat on the y direction they will

368
00:21:58,549 --> 00:21:59,645
give a limitation on the y-axis

369
00:22:00,509 --> 00:22:04,509
and if you combine these two together

370
00:22:04,509 --> 00:22:09,950
you are limiting the movement of the
current node to out to 100 back 200 box

371
00:22:09,095 --> 00:22:12,183
very very simple to use you no longer
have the right all these update code

372
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:18,135
that will manually snapped the object
back in the box

373
00:22:19,035 --> 00:22:22,083
so in summary it really hope you remove
a lot of the boilerplate cold

374
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:25,542
making sure you just try to call the
focusing on building the game you want

375
00:22:26,289 --> 00:22:26,351
rather than

376
00:22:26,909 --> 00:22:30,240
having to fix up things and also the

377
00:22:30,024 --> 00:22:33,062
because the cost ran to the is our rainy
that

378
00:22:33,062 --> 00:22:36,751
you care add the ER the cost model

379
00:22:37,309 --> 00:22:41,190
constraints into the same Iran and order
of evaluation happens from

380
00:22:41,019 --> 00:22:45,100
well is based on the order of things are
going to direct I we also offer a lot of

381
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,149
varieties of constraint position or
orientation

382
00:22:49,149 --> 00:22:52,247
and distance

383
00:22:53,129 --> 00:22:57,690
next I like to talk about numerous
kinematics is usually a very strange

384
00:22:57,069 --> 00:22:58,133
word for people who doesn't have

385
00:22:59,033 --> 00:23:02,120
I are a mechanical engineering degree of
people happen

386
00:23:03,002 --> 00:23:06,731
returner animation engine three members
kinematics

387
00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:11,240
allow you to use can manage the
equations to solve

388
00:23:11,024 --> 00:23:15,053
the joint problem occurs if you have a
drawing hierarchy trying to reach for

389
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:16,283
things

390
00:23:16,409 --> 00:23:21,370
in a 2d space so here I am trying to use
the robot arm reaching for where my

391
00:23:21,037 --> 00:23:22,426
mouse cursors pointing

392
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:26,764
and I want to set up the exact behavior
of Hall robot will move

393
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:31,480
I magnin to do than your update yourself
and try to do as every frame okays easy

394
00:23:31,048 --> 00:23:34,337
to move the hand and now what does the
the lower Hannah's gonna do

395
00:23:34,769 --> 00:23:37,772
I followed by what is our brands gonna
do to provide a realistic

396
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:40,885
behavior so you can do this for arms and
you can't do this for lax

397
00:23:41,659 --> 00:23:44,970
you can do it with plan with the
animation

398
00:23:44,097 --> 00:23:48,110
so number one abusing a schematic thing
you have a joint hierarchy

399
00:23:49,001 --> 00:23:52,920
so for example if a look at a robot arm
it's a drawing of three pieces

400
00:23:53,019 --> 00:23:56,370
we start with the our problem that's

401
00:23:56,037 --> 00:23:59,098
the root node followed by the lower arm

402
00:23:59,098 --> 00:24:02,367
which attach as a child to Darbar

403
00:24:03,249 --> 00:24:06,303
and I'll have the claw which is attach
other child

404
00:24:06,789 --> 00:24:12,740
to the lower arm to not use of these
joints to create real estate look

405
00:24:12,074 --> 00:24:15,083
I need to set up some cost rain for
example

406
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:18,562
my are my all bull probably opens at 180
degrees

407
00:24:19,309 --> 00:24:23,690
and close up 30 and anything beyond the
Rangers gonna snap I can't take it

408
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:24,128
anymore

409
00:24:24,749 --> 00:24:28,775
I am so you can set up the cost ran for
each individual notebook

410
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:33,090
create that really realistic behavior

411
00:24:33,009 --> 00:24:37,418
so with bracket how do you do inverse
kinematics all the way I set up the cost

412
00:24:37,499 --> 00:24:40,970
rain how do I setup the parent-child
hierarchy

413
00:24:40,097 --> 00:24:43,196
you don't have to do that because we use
the existing single out there already

414
00:24:44,096 --> 00:24:45,905
have the parent-child relationship

415
00:24:46,769 --> 00:24:51,070
and we are good to go the only thing in
your set-up a setting up the cost reins

416
00:24:51,007 --> 00:24:53,062
of how each client's open and close

417
00:24:53,062 --> 00:24:57,361
create a realistic look that you want
and we provide actions to drive these

418
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:58,620
cars trains

419
00:24:58,062 --> 00:25:01,961
other track so that's why Israel case
there are you think a point

420
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:05,840
so by default Inc appointed .5 .5 I may
live

421
00:25:05,084 --> 00:25:08,096
realistic format shoulder obvious at all

422
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:12,285
0.5 r0 land 0.5

423
00:25:13,149 --> 00:25:16,173
so the cost rather we sat as call ask a
risk of strain of Dec

424
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:19,480
is simply have to property the lower
angle Amanda upper angle limit

425
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:23,590
once you have the school angles
specified

426
00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:27,348
you can attach that to any of the SK
know that in the scene

427
00:25:27,879 --> 00:25:31,917
and now we have a perfectly working
drawing hierarchy hauled away

428
00:25:32,259 --> 00:25:35,264
drive it to drive it would provide SK

429
00:25:35,309 --> 00:25:38,330
actions we have two variants reach to
know

430
00:25:38,033 --> 00:25:41,034
I reached to position so if you wanna
restore

431
00:25:41,034 --> 00:25:44,753
a moving target on a stationary position
within the scene

432
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:48,460
you can use I they're all the variants
that's being specified

433
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:51,745
so here have a quick example of
one-liner

434
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,185
writing running the ASCII action of
reaching

435
00:25:55,419 --> 00:25:59,570
a constraint so here we have a simple
Ford three joints

436
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:02,070
constraint is constrained a 2.0 have

437
00:26:02,007 --> 00:26:05,095
across rate of opening from 0 to 180
degrees as you can see when the mouse

438
00:26:06,058 --> 00:26:06,637
moves

439
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:10,490
he actually obeys the cost ran a tight
not to over ban

440
00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:13,358
and but really give you that realistic
look of

441
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:17,882
mechanical Bell mechanical me I

442
00:26:18,629 --> 00:26:21,654
and now we also take the same embers
kinda Matix

443
00:26:21,879 --> 00:26:25,870
calmer too sweetie a place much much
more interesting but it's also very

444
00:26:25,087 --> 00:26:27,506
closely implemented just like this by
Cape

445
00:26:28,289 --> 00:26:31,850
API's we have escaped I see I K cost
rain

446
00:26:31,085 --> 00:26:35,169
and he still has a ask it cost rains RA
you can say discuss radar

447
00:26:36,069 --> 00:26:39,398
also have a animation influence factor
so here

448
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:43,070
just give real a quick demo have a 3d
scene

449
00:26:43,529 --> 00:26:46,543
with the 3d character playing a part
animation

450
00:26:46,669 --> 00:26:50,960
nothing is and nothing else and running

451
00:26:50,096 --> 00:26:53,805
but now with I K running I K Camp
Blanding

452
00:26:54,669 --> 00:26:58,990
are top of the animation playback at 60
frames per second

453
00:26:58,099 --> 00:27:01,518
making sure the hand is always Ponting
and a red party

454
00:27:02,409 --> 00:27:05,446
so now imagine a possibility of I'm
building a pennis game

455
00:27:05,779 --> 00:27:08,850
all I now need is 20 nations why is that

456
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:11,134
back panel and for paddle everything
else are light

457
00:27:12,034 --> 00:27:15,043
I keep a caravan so I don't have the
field but given the number of animation

458
00:27:16,024 --> 00:27:17,423
combinations for the game

459
00:27:17,639 --> 00:27:20,648
also have the realistic a lot so that's
really open up

460
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:27,190
a lot of opportunity

461
00:27:27,019 --> 00:27:30,061
so in summary I you working americans
really easy to use

462
00:27:30,061 --> 00:27:33,600
you don't even need to set it up the the
scene crop take care of it

463
00:27:34,149 --> 00:27:38,080
at a cost rains can be set on every
single drawing they have you got caught

464
00:27:38,008 --> 00:27:39,107
on the opening and closing angle

465
00:27:40,007 --> 00:27:44,019
and to drive these chains users run a
single action one-liner

466
00:27:44,019 --> 00:27:48,388
tell the going to resell for position
Arnold

467
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:53,820
next wanna talk about physics field

468
00:27:53,082 --> 00:27:56,801
now physics feels our type of your
forces

469
00:27:57,539 --> 00:28:02,590
the applied the generator forces to the
object that's being part of the scene

470
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:06,730
so here I am having a space cannon
launching of cannonballs

471
00:28:06,073 --> 00:28:11,078
that interact with two different real
gravity field

472
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:17,172
as you can see as the cannonballs gets
closer to the planet

473
00:28:17,379 --> 00:28:21,360
the thank D Alene your where at the
linear acceleration gets covered in two

474
00:28:21,036 --> 00:28:22,725
angular velocity and

475
00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:27,071
star orbiting the planar shows how

476
00:28:27,269 --> 00:28:31,271
so we use the feels personally Anne
physical feel forces

477
00:28:31,289 --> 00:28:35,341
and feels can interact was the fifth his
body that's in the region

478
00:28:35,809 --> 00:28:39,880
and the reason is the place where we
define the field effect area

479
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:44,520
and we have a lot of different feels
less provided as this release

480
00:28:44,529 --> 00:28:47,580
but the ball pen of them so when does
feel

481
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:51,113
get updated so number one I need to have
feel knows

482
00:28:51,779 --> 00:28:55,740
in the scene graph they're just like any
ask a naughty cat add them to a scene

483
00:28:55,074 --> 00:28:58,843
you can run action on them as well you
can pattern it when other sprite

484
00:28:59,509 --> 00:29:03,080
so you want to have I really big cookie
planet

485
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:07,097
you to add every to grab the field as a
child a move that could be planned in

486
00:29:07,097 --> 00:29:08,276
Iran and India

487
00:29:09,149 --> 00:29:12,970
the field is gonna for follow it and
even after this body that's located

488
00:29:12,097 --> 00:29:13,144
within the region

489
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:18,893
and a bit mathematics is the interaction
was are happening

490
00:29:19,289 --> 00:29:22,324
now the cutoff feels feels would provide
the law to prohibit ers are you

491
00:29:22,639 --> 00:29:26,220
allowed to get the exact look and
different interactions for you

492
00:29:26,022 --> 00:29:29,034
what you can't control number one reason
that's

493
00:29:29,034 --> 00:29:32,109
the area of the fact of whole big of the
area want

494
00:29:33,009 --> 00:29:36,218
the field to interact with you there
with

495
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:40,220
now the strength you come by in
combination of all of

496
00:29:40,022 --> 00:29:43,951
controls what's the magnitude of force
that's being applied to eat some

497
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:46,177
individual object that's in the field

498
00:29:46,429 --> 00:29:50,429
I minimum radius as just a clamp 3ds and
a bit

499
00:29:50,429 --> 00:29:54,478
mask can be used to differentiate which
fits his body you want to interact with

500
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:57,005
this field or not

501
00:29:57,779 --> 00:30:00,876
now let's look at the region's that's
key regions defined the area of the fact

502
00:30:01,749 --> 00:30:03,590
for this particular field

503
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:06,108
the reason defies this DC area in 20
space

504
00:30:07,008 --> 00:30:11,307
by default it is infinite and you can
create a rectangle circle are you ok

505
00:30:11,379 --> 00:30:12,456
with region from CD path

506
00:30:13,149 --> 00:30:16,570
began to a lot of complicated operation
on them like

507
00:30:16,057 --> 00:30:20,606
in bird from track Union intersect so
far from here on building

508
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:24,970
I'll earth here and their real gravity
are on earth

509
00:30:24,097 --> 00:30:28,536
is you can see is pouring everything
towards the center

510
00:30:29,409 --> 00:30:33,820
so you have this into physics bodies
feels kept also interact with

511
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:37,761
bracket particle effects so as long as
you said the field bit mask on a

512
00:30:38,499 --> 00:30:39,460
particle in fact

513
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:43,097
every single minute object particles can
interact with the field so here we have

514
00:30:43,097 --> 00:30:45,936
a noise field out playa coherent noise
force

515
00:30:46,809 --> 00:30:49,904
to you so that you made a particles

516
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:53,795
now let's look at some other the basic
feel that's been provided so

517
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:57,124
everyone can to get a feeling of what
feels

518
00:30:57,169 --> 00:31:00,200
are really looking like

519
00:31:00,002 --> 00:31:03,026
so by default would provide the
basically no gravity field this is just

520
00:31:03,044 --> 00:31:04,473
to simulate Earth's gravity

521
00:31:04,869 --> 00:31:08,990
in one dimension I can change in the
direction many times only for co-op

522
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:12,378
they were attracted the object at a
correct location

523
00:31:13,269 --> 00:31:16,950
a second if I wanna similar laid a space
game have a plant ariane

524
00:31:16,095 --> 00:31:19,134
gravity a fact we have the real gravity

525
00:31:19,989 --> 00:31:24,190
of you know they can't get you can use
for example here too object carries a

526
00:31:24,019 --> 00:31:27,328
linear velocity but I when the rates
close to the orbit

527
00:31:27,499 --> 00:31:31,970
I billion a gravity coming into I
angular velocities org BRK actually

528
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:33,046
Korean I get around the

529
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,860
the planet we also have a Springfield

530
00:31:37,086 --> 00:31:41,515
this is imaginary fielder the demanding
every single object in the scene

531
00:31:42,289 --> 00:31:46,700
in the field actually have a spring hook
from land and attached to the north

532
00:31:46,007 --> 00:31:51,031
so here you can see there being of the
late it back and forth

533
00:31:51,094 --> 00:31:54,159
I we also have noise field that apply a
coherent

534
00:31:55,059 --> 00:31:58,858
noise force to every single object
that's being

535
00:31:59,389 --> 00:32:04,467
participate in a scene

536
00:32:05,169 --> 00:32:08,600
an elective feels a particularly cool so

537
00:32:08,006 --> 00:32:12,315
imagine YouTube dog have targeted
positive charges a negative charges and

538
00:32:12,909 --> 00:32:12,992
here we have

539
00:32:13,739 --> 00:32:16,767
a you like to feel that carries

540
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:20,580
positive target and positive charge
tracks

541
00:32:20,058 --> 00:32:24,070
objects with negative charges i repel

542
00:32:24,007 --> 00:32:27,546
object with the same card so here rad
particles

543
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:33,243
are red can answer actually wanna carry
positive Kartik at repel the way

544
00:32:33,639 --> 00:32:36,717
and the green ones carries the negative
charge and being a track and

545
00:32:37,419 --> 00:32:40,515
in Iraq with the electric feel

546
00:32:41,379 --> 00:32:45,070
to feel that would provide physics you
with us building blocks is like Lengel

547
00:32:45,007 --> 00:32:45,070
see

548
00:32:45,007 --> 00:32:49,346
feel free to interacted with the I'm
build combine them together

549
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:54,040
to get combine them up together to have
a big building blocks

550
00:32:54,049 --> 00:32:57,061
I eat on the field to interact with
different field

551
00:32:57,169 --> 00:33:02,176
so for example we found wanna
implemented one variation of the Lorenz

552
00:33:02,239 --> 00:33:07,317
a tractor I can simply have for magnetic
feel sitting right by each other with

553
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:09,350
opposite charge

554
00:33:09,035 --> 00:33:12,674
and what happens if I send a particles

555
00:33:12,989 --> 00:33:19,989
through the field that's what it look
like

556
00:33:20,021 --> 00:33:23,810
for which is very cool

557
00:33:23,999 --> 00:33:27,090
thank you

558
00:33:27,909 --> 00:33:30,996
so in some rain the feels a very fast
they're very efficient

559
00:33:31,779 --> 00:33:35,804
we have a brand new implementation for
and we actually have a lot of

560
00:33:36,029 --> 00:33:39,032
spend a lot of them as a cipher on this
feature

561
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:43,094
and you can use fielding interact either
physics bodies a party cause to have a

562
00:33:43,409 --> 00:33:46,950
really fine interaction experience for
the user

563
00:33:46,095 --> 00:33:49,183
and you can also use feels to interact
with other feel to have a comp

564
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:54,161
combined effect next i wanna talk about
integration I think it

565
00:33:55,061 --> 00:33:58,480
we work really closely together with the
sink a team to make sure we have the

566
00:33:59,029 --> 00:34:00,590
best possible experience

567
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:03,072
a brain 3d content into 20 games

568
00:34:03,072 --> 00:34:07,151
so here we have a demo spaceship is in
3d object that scene that will be seen

569
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:09,720
as a mother to

570
00:34:09,072 --> 00:34:13,261
same as the asteroid last seen a 3d 3d
optimal brain

571
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:17,936
into debt to the background

572
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:21,310
so the immigration bring your
possibilities to

573
00:34:21,031 --> 00:34:24,840
developing to the game so we can now you
can't official E

574
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:28,450
includes week of animals fighting games
you can't control

575
00:34:28,045 --> 00:34:32,124
any of the 3d object just like any other
ask a naughty can run action on it and

576
00:34:33,024 --> 00:34:33,032
run scale

577
00:34:34,004 --> 00:34:39,823
you can make it fall path are you make
any 3d manipulations

578
00:34:39,859 --> 00:34:43,911
aids deeply integrated of the two
Fremont yet we remain loosely coupled

579
00:34:44,379 --> 00:34:48,379
as two independent I am solutions for
the game developers

580
00:34:48,379 --> 00:34:51,407
so is render very efficiently together
think it is rendering

581
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:54,706
directly into the open GL contact when
are passing when are rendering to

582
00:34:55,129 --> 00:34:57,203
texture and the passing tax R&B
financial framework

583
00:34:57,869 --> 00:35:01,230
this is a very efficient solution

584
00:35:01,023 --> 00:35:04,382
so the bring 3d coffin into toward the
base games

585
00:35:04,589 --> 00:35:07,960
we create a ask a 3d known it is the
toll free bridge

586
00:35:07,096 --> 00:35:11,115
allow it to incorporate any 3d
continental spiking based games

587
00:35:12,015 --> 00:35:16,078
so once you have sk3 naughty cat
attacked any of the st. in scenes

588
00:35:16,078 --> 00:35:19,126
to this ass case we know you know the
fight to render in this

589
00:35:20,026 --> 00:35:23,119
SKC once you have the as he is seeing
you can set

590
00:35:24,019 --> 00:35:27,091
essence in property I S case we denote
and the all-star using this

591
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:31,800
CK render in our in the past

592
00:35:32,619 --> 00:35:36,760
so how do we create as case we know we
have the initializer create a scene old

593
00:35:36,076 --> 00:35:39,077
where three or four sides you specify i
sat excise

594
00:35:39,077 --> 00:35:43,089
you can attach to any of the ass unity
in a scene casings are sinking of Jack

595
00:35:43,089 --> 00:35:46,117
through the as he has seen property

596
00:35:47,017 --> 00:35:51,020
you also have access to Essien no which
gives you the point of view all were two

597
00:35:51,047 --> 00:35:51,926
people camera

598
00:35:52,349 --> 00:35:56,440
all if there is a camera where's the
pointer why the camera looking at the

599
00:35:56,044 --> 00:35:57,066
current scene

600
00:35:57,066 --> 00:36:00,705
and everything doesn't have any lighting
you can use a one-liner automatic

601
00:36:01,299 --> 00:36:05,306
although we enable the for lighting that
will to wrong at the fall I to the scene

602
00:36:05,369 --> 00:36:08,630
so all the objects a property let

603
00:36:08,063 --> 00:36:12,099
so here's a quick example gonna add a 3d
a Leo from a COLLADA following to ask a

604
00:36:12,099 --> 00:36:13,102
scene

605
00:36:14,002 --> 00:36:18,003
we just call it gets really know
initialize without the fall your part

606
00:36:18,003 --> 00:36:22,052
Lauder St Encino that said a senior
added to

607
00:36:22,052 --> 00:36:27,871
added to the SKC now the 3d alien object
is going to appear

608
00:36:28,339 --> 00:36:33,220
now you think we should also gold both
ways spike in now powers all the tax a

609
00:36:33,022 --> 00:36:34,113
need for C can as well as South

610
00:36:35,013 --> 00:36:38,702
so you can use any spray kit texture
object directly all seen care

611
00:36:38,819 --> 00:36:42,160
but including all the tools we build
from the last version

612
00:36:42,016 --> 00:36:45,088
which is the automatic tax for Apple as
generation with an axe or

613
00:36:45,088 --> 00:36:48,146
as well as that procedurally generated
lot of normal map

614
00:36:49,046 --> 00:36:53,053
weekend you to automatically generate a
normal map but iraq any 3d object

615
00:36:53,053 --> 00:36:57,099
and the fact looks really really cool as
regular I think it also share the same

616
00:36:57,099 --> 00:37:00,150
audio playback interface

617
00:37:01,005 --> 00:37:04,012
so having the innovation within the
toll-free much really really

618
00:37:05,002 --> 00:37:09,621
add a lot of possibilities here you can
have another level interaction with your

619
00:37:09,819 --> 00:37:13,990
user for example have a cough and
background of three also the UCR 3d

620
00:37:13,099 --> 00:37:14,107
object flying on the screen

621
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:19,121
is actually making user having of a
third perspective

622
00:37:20,021 --> 00:37:24,027
of what a game look like last year i
wanna talk about

623
00:37:24,027 --> 00:37:27,096
tools here so for ask 06

624
00:37:27,096 --> 00:37:30,121
we have released a brand-new spiky
editor

625
00:37:31,021 --> 00:37:34,095
it is part of actual release and you can
use it to create

626
00:37:34,095 --> 00:37:38,126
any of the game scenes without reading
any coal you can also use it in Iraq any

627
00:37:39,026 --> 00:37:41,048
of this bracket features

628
00:37:41,048 --> 00:37:44,897
international everything you have seen
here today

629
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:48,331
can be down instead of biking editor
without writing

630
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:52,420
any lines of code a forces you also

631
00:37:52,042 --> 00:37:58,201
switch to are thank you

632
00:37:58,579 --> 00:38:02,601
he also be able to you to ride the
data-driven

633
00:38:02,799 --> 00:38:07,803
a model raining games usually deal with
a lot of data

634
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:11,861
and we want to shift focus from focusing
on designing one level

635
00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:16,114
rather than have a generic approach of
data oriented programming model

636
00:38:16,609 --> 00:38:20,400
so now always cranky at a fair we
actually separate the game content from

637
00:38:20,004 --> 00:38:21,029
the game logic

638
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:24,118
so you no longer have to manually add a
spaceship

639
00:38:25,018 --> 00:38:28,024
Saturday be a tent and along to the game
compiler

640
00:38:28,024 --> 00:38:31,078
lost a game and I'm about five petals of
maybe I'll

641
00:38:31,078 --> 00:38:34,897
at if I pixels and it picked all the
getting work all of your uterus and

642
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:41,622
process

643
00:38:41,829 --> 00:38:44,881
I we also provide a simplified game
template

644
00:38:45,349 --> 00:38:48,380
that simple so swift and objective-c

645
00:38:48,038 --> 00:38:51,091
so although the box your good ago and I
have a brand new

646
00:38:51,091 --> 00:38:55,530
seem created for you ready for drag and
drop in play create your level

647
00:38:56,349 --> 00:39:00,421
and making sure your game is running on
day one

648
00:39:01,069 --> 00:39:04,930
not only you can use Preki added her as
a editor you can use it as a bee partner

649
00:39:04,093 --> 00:39:05,272
as well

650
00:39:06,109 --> 00:39:10,204
so if you're in the middle running your
scene wanna be your ship becomes missing

651
00:39:11,059 --> 00:39:14,670
you can use this one line of code is
paid the in the debugger

652
00:39:14,067 --> 00:39:18,141
you gather SKS file I guess what you can
load that back in ice cold I see what

653
00:39:19,041 --> 00:39:22,940
was going off on ice in the neutral back
exactly we'll see her ricky is

654
00:39:23,309 --> 00:39:27,650
so in the case of say if the spaceship
to hear them because it is the order

655
00:39:27,065 --> 00:39:30,074
you can totally see that within the ACO

656
00:39:30,074 --> 00:39:33,115
and if you have existing game that not
even written

657
00:39:34,015 --> 00:39:37,069
for the door in a programming you can
use the same line of code of your life

658
00:39:37,069 --> 00:39:37,153
out

659
00:39:38,053 --> 00:39:41,072
and even you to retouch it or adding

660
00:39:41,549 --> 00:39:46,549
new features dragging the waco and use
the editor and add new features and

661
00:39:46,549 --> 00:39:52,680
they are ready to go

662
00:39:52,068 --> 00:39:55,094
so some other basic features that would
provide respect the editor allowed to do

663
00:39:55,094 --> 00:39:58,763
basic object manipulation a placement
they include position

664
00:39:59,609 --> 00:40:03,430
or am patient and scale you can set up a
fifth his body is

665
00:40:03,043 --> 00:40:06,138
Bonnie box pong sarcos are you in a
brand-new per pixel physics

666
00:40:07,038 --> 00:40:10,075
set up you can bring a 3d content from
qualified

667
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:13,116
directly into a $20 seniors saving and
loading game

668
00:40:14,016 --> 00:40:17,103
I see the 3d object and ready for ready
to be manipulated

669
00:40:18,003 --> 00:40:22,342
an we can set up your shadows on
lighting your fax line numerous

670
00:40:22,369 --> 00:40:23,400
kinematics

671
00:40:23,004 --> 00:40:26,163
because I mean a schematic a joint
hierarchy right inside

672
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:29,650
echoed and preview that a factor right
here

673
00:40:29,065 --> 00:40:33,067
we also providing integrated shave your
editor allow you to have a Weezy where

674
00:40:33,067 --> 00:40:34,148
give fact

675
00:40:35,048 --> 00:40:38,102
of adding your shoulders and 20 share
uniforms

676
00:40:39,002 --> 00:40:44,021
so I'm gonna give you a quick demo

677
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:47,680
so from Monday's talk busted up the
Union demo hopefully you have see how to

678
00:40:47,068 --> 00:40:48,477
use Pekka editor to create

679
00:40:49,089 --> 00:40:52,115
his body set up for pics of ethics have

680
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:55,450
illusions and also in Iraq with few
forces

681
00:40:55,045 --> 00:40:59,102
and 3d object so from Monday's talk
busted up the Union demo hopefully you

682
00:41:00,002 --> 00:41:01,096
have see how to use Pekka editor to
create

683
00:41:01,096 --> 00:41:04,435
his body set up for pics of ethics have

684
00:41:05,299 --> 00:41:08,380
illusions and also in Iraq with few
forces

685
00:41:08,038 --> 00:41:12,043
a 3d object so today the topping I'm
gonna cover is how to use

686
00:41:12,043 --> 00:41:15,682
spike it added her to set up lights
shadows

687
00:41:16,069 --> 00:41:19,700
using inverse kinematics haha use the
building she there at a tear to quickly

688
00:41:19,007 --> 00:41:20,346
to reduce haters

689
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:24,530
with us have a look so here

690
00:41:24,053 --> 00:41:27,882
we have a brand new lighting thing so
nothing here

691
00:41:28,359 --> 00:41:32,000
and ready to go I'll if you click

692
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,579
in the Object Library this give you any
existing textures that in the current

693
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:38,660
project sorry fighters dragging ok
almost all

694
00:41:38,066 --> 00:41:41,099
and I can make it slightly bigger

695
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:44,099
anatole see any of the spike it with it
you just open

696
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:47,120
object library here and because we're
adding strike a scene is contact

697
00:41:48,002 --> 00:41:48,055
sensitive

698
00:41:48,073 --> 00:41:51,125
no's these artists backing of Jack
that's relevant for this

699
00:41:52,025 --> 00:41:55,096
others editing experience now as drag a
light im

700
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:58,100
doesn't know quite what I want yet
because I haven't let yet

701
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,829
as you can see the lighting mask that we
have on the sprite

702
00:42:02,829 --> 00:42:06,450
a cobblestone is not set here for said
to be one

703
00:42:06,045 --> 00:42:09,074
you see there right away no colder
writing nothing

704
00:42:09,074 --> 00:42:12,172
sorry for saying this file loading your
scene this is exactly what you're gonna

705
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:13,421
get

706
00:42:14,069 --> 00:42:19,000
because spec added her actually use a
spike it writings on tobacco

707
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,027
so now we can move to see around will
delight a row

708
00:42:22,027 --> 00:42:26,856
as a defining a fact and now it's kinda
to the yes camp Landis

709
00:42:27,099 --> 00:42:30,390
maybe we can change that texture so we
can automatically generate a normal map

710
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:31,046
on the fly

711
00:42:31,046 --> 00:42:36,051
say from my make stole a base sharp but
also have a big contrast

712
00:42:36,051 --> 00:42:39,052
I can do that as a two numbers

713
00:42:39,052 --> 00:42:42,341
and if I wanna make a slightly in the
name and

714
00:42:42,809 --> 00:42:46,930
too sharp my look very discomfort walk
all

715
00:42:46,093 --> 00:42:51,492
so fire want to have lower that that's
slightly more subtle look and if I moved

716
00:42:52,329 --> 00:42:53,410
at

717
00:42:53,041 --> 00:42:56,430
object for ron is can see the light real

718
00:42:56,799 --> 00:42:59,890
feel like the mouth let's go ahead and
add

719
00:42:59,089 --> 00:43:02,091
a storm object here

720
00:43:02,091 --> 00:43:06,142
a little bit to bake that make a smaller
and I want the stone to be lit as well

721
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:08,141
so let's settle any mass two-b_-one

722
00:43:09,041 --> 00:43:12,042
same as the same object

723
00:43:12,042 --> 00:43:15,951
okay am because the law we want to have
a maybe a

724
00:43:16,329 --> 00:43:20,240
a 3d Lockhart as maybe stone will need a
cash adl's we just need to

725
00:43:20,024 --> 00:43:26,040
sectional mask on that move it around it

726
00:43:26,004 --> 00:43:29,031
and now weekend change some properties

727
00:43:29,067 --> 00:43:32,118
applying so I can change that light in
color

728
00:43:33,018 --> 00:43:36,024
well that's a little weird

729
00:43:36,078 --> 00:43:41,597
something normal ish warm color is the
way to go

730
00:43:42,299 --> 00:43:45,375
so there hustlers you hear the File Save

731
00:43:46,059 --> 00:43:50,210
the scene is ready and you are good to
go you don't have to

732
00:43:50,021 --> 00:43:54,073
to ask a line 0 the in net added 14
position he called

733
00:43:54,073 --> 00:43:57,102
non-black so very cool

734
00:43:58,002 --> 00:44:02,020
from necktie washoe is humor schematic
so here I have a pre-assembled robot

735
00:44:02,002 --> 00:44:06,085
I'm just gonna give you a quick a review
so here I have Armada Jack

736
00:44:07,003 --> 00:44:11,592
Armas para they directly to the scene
for the RR

737
00:44:11,619 --> 00:44:14,750
the lower arm as attached as a parent
for

738
00:44:14,075 --> 00:44:17,614
upper arm and have a claw where iPad

739
00:44:18,289 --> 00:44:21,910
to the lower soul to what are set up

740
00:44:21,091 --> 00:44:25,128
humor schematic for this robot I just
need to start simulating

741
00:44:26,028 --> 00:44:29,327
solak these object

742
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:32,627
an ACA I can run in a schematic on the
robot

743
00:44:33,059 --> 00:44:36,700
reins of the editor and to see how a
setup

744
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:39,156
and if you want that doesn't look quite
right maybe and you to set a little bit

745
00:44:39,849 --> 00:44:41,240
of constraint on their

746
00:44:41,024 --> 00:44:46,099
maybe annual limit to say ninety-degree
200 ATT grateful dead right

747
00:44:46,099 --> 00:44:52,188
and you can have the same effect

748
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:56,510
as you can see actually respect many
will not over a band arm

749
00:44:56,051 --> 00:44:59,051
the all so that simmers kinematics

750
00:44:59,051 --> 00:45:02,095
very easy to set up again you don't have
the right any lines of code

751
00:45:02,095 --> 00:45:05,098
to see the quarterback on use any of the
features here

752
00:45:06,025 --> 00:45:09,094
but i wanna go over a shade urs your
shoulders

753
00:45:09,319 --> 00:45:14,500
is very easy so here from that which it
lybrand I can does polling

754
00:45:14,005 --> 00:45:17,864
a solid color of Sprite here happened
have

755
00:45:18,359 --> 00:45:22,435
hey custom share Nana can run Holloway
said a concentrator

756
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:27,130
specchio added automatic process the
workspace a figure out how many FS it

757
00:45:27,013 --> 00:45:28,192
file that you have

758
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:31,310
so here have a single one I said that
ample

759
00:45:31,319 --> 00:45:38,130
I'm good to go so

760
00:45:38,013 --> 00:45:41,076
this is only half the equation to
actually

761
00:45:41,076 --> 00:45:45,355
the the eatery shakespeare's is even
better

762
00:45:46,039 --> 00:45:49,067
to hear if I wanna make a change to the
satyr

763
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:52,323
I just Colleen the assistant editor

764
00:45:52,359 --> 00:45:56,378
if I just click on the object n knows
what shade or use

765
00:45:56,549 --> 00:45:59,630
a bring up the sheeter source side by
side ready to

766
00:45:59,063 --> 00:46:03,088
added you ready to make changes a
monetary whole workspace

767
00:46:03,088 --> 00:46:06,096
so now if I know this the the

768
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:09,098
3ds are the center of the circle I wanna
shifted a little bit

769
00:46:10,016 --> 00:46:13,655
save exchange 2.2 I'm point2

770
00:46:13,799 --> 00:46:18,410
and then what happened usually you need
to rebuild your application

771
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:22,052
injury run the application the
application will upload new cedar

772
00:46:22,052 --> 00:46:25,065
to open to: drivers to your driver will
compile whether

773
00:46:25,065 --> 00:46:29,089
if you forget a semi-colon guess what
you start the process again

774
00:46:29,089 --> 00:46:32,143
here you just needed to file safe

775
00:46:33,043 --> 00:46:37,067
so if I make of an automatic say for me
reverted back to .5

776
00:46:37,067 --> 00:46:42,140
5 File Save see the live change right
here

777
00:46:43,004 --> 00:46:46,393
I what if I decide to add a brand-new
uniforms

778
00:46:46,789 --> 00:46:51,900
to the shade or so here I wanna at a be
the primary so I can control

779
00:46:51,009 --> 00:46:54,478
the fact that I'm having here so if I
save that

780
00:46:55,369 --> 00:46:58,442
guess what you have real opened y'all
penalties in the air

781
00:46:59,099 --> 00:47:03,460
Writing Center max code so here because
I introduce a new uniform

782
00:47:03,046 --> 00:47:06,128
that is not being been cleared for the
decoration of current I'm fails

783
00:47:07,028 --> 00:47:10,043
Anne the two the to other places that
reference

784
00:47:10,043 --> 00:47:14,222
talk aren't I'm will fail as well so how
do we fix that because we're at his new

785
00:47:14,609 --> 00:47:15,530
uniform

786
00:47:15,053 --> 00:47:19,053
at school had at that in a dictionary

787
00:47:19,053 --> 00:47:22,882
so because we calling it you speed will
make sure to name matches

788
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:27,180
you speed and has a value of $0

789
00:47:27,018 --> 00:47:30,092
and about change that one I see that
live in fact a ride

790
00:47:30,092 --> 00:47:33,100
in the editor and make a spin faster

791
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,046
both ears okay let me go slower

792
00:47:39,046 --> 00:47:44,365
saw live CD ratting riding subway

793
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:47,860
the less the demo of all respected
editor

794
00:47:48,589 --> 00:47:51,616
lastly I wanna go over for me additional
improvements that we have done to the

795
00:47:51,859 --> 00:47:55,150
existing spike a priori API's

796
00:47:55,015 --> 00:47:59,194
so for those available and Neal to spike
it here's the brand new

797
00:47:59,329 --> 00:48:03,405
updates clock that we have done for this
year

798
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:07,167
as the frame starts we start with up
they function so this is where you can

799
00:48:07,869 --> 00:48:10,200
sample game logic

800
00:48:10,002 --> 00:48:14,058
after that see more starting value
actions

801
00:48:14,076 --> 00:48:17,355
after the actions i evaluate it user get
a call back

802
00:48:18,039 --> 00:48:21,730
thing okay if I animate are moved as of
Dec from A to B

803
00:48:21,073 --> 00:48:24,402
do I need to do anything else after the
actions

804
00:48:25,059 --> 00:48:30,250
physics kicks in and set up the
physically step in for the Frank

805
00:48:30,025 --> 00:48:33,584
once physics simulations finished user
get another call back with this

806
00:48:33,809 --> 00:48:35,160
personally physics

807
00:48:35,016 --> 00:48:38,215
this is where you can set up say and the
player gets pushed off

808
00:48:38,359 --> 00:48:41,690
maybe I moved back by another five
pixels

809
00:48:41,069 --> 00:48:44,678
and now with the brand use sconce crazy
P I we adding

810
00:48:45,299 --> 00:48:49,326
a scene will apply ka strains right at
this moment

811
00:48:49,569 --> 00:48:54,010
of the cost trance are being applied
user get another notification

812
00:48:54,001 --> 00:48:59,045
up with did cut apply constraint and now
we also add one more selector for user

813
00:48:59,045 --> 00:49:04,050
to react on cockpit finish optic this is
absolutely the last stop before us break

814
00:49:04,005 --> 00:49:05,096
a package everything up and send it to
the

815
00:49:06,041 --> 00:49:09,670
graphics to view for the conference

816
00:49:10,039 --> 00:49:14,041
let's break it renders the car frame and
the same loop continues

817
00:49:14,059 --> 00:49:18,065
sixty times a second now asking texture

818
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:21,162
got delayed the revamp here weep
introduce a new type of picture

819
00:49:21,549 --> 00:49:22,631
commutable taxer

820
00:49:23,369 --> 00:49:26,390
you can create from data can be modified
very efficiently

821
00:49:26,039 --> 00:49:29,045
every frame we provide a call back block
allow you to make

822
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:32,126
modification to the raw pointers so here
if I'm just

823
00:49:33,026 --> 00:49:36,385
make it tended to the raw pixel data you
can set that

824
00:49:36,619 --> 00:49:40,690
so if you have a really core CPU based
post-processing in fact you wanna

825
00:49:40,069 --> 00:49:40,150
modifier

826
00:49:41,005 --> 00:49:45,344
attacker you have the freedom to do that
if you want to have a custom

827
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:49,650
data you wanna Senate wash Eder as the
input by setting up a

828
00:49:49,065 --> 00:49:53,094
all the betas taxers you can do that as
well

829
00:49:53,094 --> 00:49:56,773
also SK taxers can generate nooit noise
textures now

830
00:49:57,619 --> 00:50:01,693
degenerate coherent noise that gives you
that lard and noise factor farmers fear

831
00:50:02,359 --> 00:50:05,381
so it's a for both the noise generator
in the crease kill color

832
00:50:05,579 --> 00:50:09,880
grayscale or the color of it events
generate some noise factor

833
00:50:09,088 --> 00:50:13,287
we have to stay in there that the color
of what specs but here to create the

834
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:17,440
that noise factor just call picture with
noise with you can control the

835
00:50:17,044 --> 00:50:17,893
smoothness

836
00:50:18,289 --> 00:50:22,290
as well as control the size

837
00:50:22,299 --> 00:50:25,480
nice kiss shape known also receive a lot
a revamped this year

838
00:50:25,048 --> 00:50:29,067
so we had a calming and constructors for
commish a plainclothes rectangles

839
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:32,070
circles eclipse and splines

840
00:50:32,007 --> 00:50:35,346
we also allow you to set picture

841
00:50:36,039 --> 00:50:39,430
shade urs football's the skulk and fell

842
00:50:39,043 --> 00:50:43,922
for the actual shape you can use shape
no to interact with your physical well

843
00:50:44,309 --> 00:50:47,910
if you build up is a very complex com
complex shape

844
00:50:47,091 --> 00:50:51,220
are using shape note you can just access
the past property directly

845
00:50:52,039 --> 00:50:56,070
and then get a CD past send it directly
to physics faces or quit his body for

846
00:50:56,349 --> 00:50:58,398
you

847
00:50:58,839 --> 00:51:03,200
we've also made creating can join much
much easier

848
00:51:03,002 --> 00:51:08,026
for with ask a physics bawdy we now have
a new property copy and

849
00:51:08,044 --> 00:51:11,088
to can object to

850
00:51:11,088 --> 00:51:15,317
another object you just need to set one
property so here I have a big year

851
00:51:16,109 --> 00:51:20,170
I wanna pin it to the board I just set a
property to yes

852
00:51:20,017 --> 00:51:23,044
speckle figure I'll all the parents the

853
00:51:23,044 --> 00:51:26,120
commercial space on whether the other
dog has his body with Pixar followed

854
00:51:27,002 --> 00:51:28,401
that detail for you

855
00:51:28,599 --> 00:51:33,750
very cool now in addition to can join
well sold make

856
00:51:33,075 --> 00:51:36,104
creating well joined really easy so

857
00:51:36,779 --> 00:51:39,838
well joining a just the same as pain
joint which means Pennycook yes

858
00:51:40,369 --> 00:51:43,417
by the fact that allow rotation my means
I'm

859
00:51:43,849 --> 00:51:46,926
welded to my parents here have small
beer

860
00:51:47,619 --> 00:51:52,680
they'll be welded to the big year so we
set to properties

861
00:51:52,068 --> 00:51:56,937
and the physics on Mac is set up for you

862
00:51:57,549 --> 00:52:00,549
e-edition Phys body can now be created
using

863
00:52:00,549 --> 00:52:04,000
copies as bodies on you to do is just in
SK

864
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,559
for the body where the new nikolai the
car body with bodies you pass in RAR

865
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:11,562
the different phases body shapes and for
example hammer here

866
00:52:11,589 --> 00:52:15,210
is campaign always two rectangles of a
top 10

867
00:52:15,021 --> 00:52:18,026
and handle

868
00:52:18,026 --> 00:52:21,545
now ask it after Alice aids our

869
00:52:21,779 --> 00:52:25,781
one of the key component to allow user
to you have efficient

870
00:52:25,799 --> 00:52:28,980
graphics performance so anything that an
attacker Alice

871
00:52:28,098 --> 00:52:31,119
we allow OpenGL to do you fish in
batting here

872
00:52:32,019 --> 00:52:35,148
so it's now support football's spike in
sync and

873
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:38,910
with poor balls right now a non-resident
not resolutions

874
00:52:38,091 --> 00:52:43,102
so if you have a game and have all the
asset putting in my folder

875
00:52:44,002 --> 00:52:46,098
the tax for Apple a generator will
separate them for you so you don't have

876
00:52:46,098 --> 00:52:47,150
to pay the memory overhead

877
00:52:48,005 --> 00:52:51,554
if you're loading the passer alors on
Iran a device

878
00:52:52,049 --> 00:52:56,730
and you have to lower their now reno
asset also support

879
00:52:56,073 --> 00:53:01,149
the for 32-bit pixel format and also to
compress 16 for Mac

880
00:53:02,049 --> 00:53:06,146
now one of the big changes way announce
a prop 24 K by 4k resolution so it's a

881
00:53:07,046 --> 00:53:07,144
simple

882
00:53:08,044 --> 00:53:13,090
are changed in the axe call settings for
your project

883
00:53:13,009 --> 00:53:18,208
yet this shit we support runtime:
patcher Apple as generation

884
00:53:19,099 --> 00:53:22,880
so if you have a downloadable content
same use a dollar on a new level

885
00:53:22,088 --> 00:53:25,287
everything is coming along files or user
take

886
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:30,079
go out to take some pictures and decide
to use action game askew map

887
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:33,079
you can to simply passing to basket
after Apple's API

888
00:53:33,079 --> 00:53:37,140
and we'll automatic a stitch it for you
and tremble to not turn

889
00:53:37,014 --> 00:53:41,153
trim to mop too transparent pixels

890
00:53:41,279 --> 00:53:45,900
so in summary we really have a lot of
new features packed in this year's

891
00:53:45,009 --> 00:53:48,010
spec a release we have a lot of cool
graphics technology like

892
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:54,099
compensators lighting and chattels we
have really course immolation the fact

893
00:53:54,099 --> 00:53:57,640
like inverse kinematics physics field

894
00:53:57,064 --> 00:54:00,523
per pixel physics and cost right

895
00:54:01,099 --> 00:54:04,200
all of these features can be down using
one-line

896
00:54:04,002 --> 00:54:07,045
are no lines at all if we use the spiky
editor

897
00:54:07,063 --> 00:54:11,102
for the spec editor is a new edition to
tackle family and is really cool feature

898
00:54:12,002 --> 00:54:12,095
how in car to

899
00:54:12,095 --> 00:54:17,244
use it and it's also a good learning
experience to see how any of the new

900
00:54:18,099 --> 00:54:21,690
features in iraq was eat with each other
